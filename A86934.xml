         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">* Ruffinus <hi>in Praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in</hi> Oſcam. <hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decim Prophetas mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores dici reſpectu qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor majorum, puta</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiae, Jeremiae, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kielis <hi>et</hi> Danielis, <hi>non ed quod iis ſententiae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum gravitate &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum verborumque ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtate cedant; ſed ob ſermones, et librorum brevitatem.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetae minores,</hi> The ſmall or leſſer Prophets; not becauſe their authority or excellency is leſſer then thoſe who are ſtiled <hi>Prophetae majores,</hi> The greater Prophets: but becauſe of the <hi>brevity and littleneſſe</hi> of their Books, which are ſo little, that all the leſſer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets put together, do but contain 67 Chapters, whereas one of the greater, (<hi>viz. Iſaiah</hi>) conſiſteth of 66. Hence it was, that theſe Books were anciently put into one Volume, and called but <hi>One Book,</hi> leſt by their littleneſſe and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe any of them (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) ſhould be loſt. Theſe Prophets are in number <hi>twelve,</hi> according to the <hi>twelve Tribes,</hi> to which they were ſent. Now though it cannot be denyed, but that there are very many excellent Commentaries already extant upon theſe leſſer Prophets, (which may haply deterre ſome men from buying, of this;) yet I deſire ſuch to take notice,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſuch is the Profundity and unconceivable Abyſſe of the <hi>Divine Scriptures,</hi> that they cannot be exhauſted by any Writers or Commentators whatſoever; but when men have dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the <hi>ſpiritual gold and ſilver</hi> they can, out of this precious Mine, there will be enough left behind for others to gather.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this Reverend Author hath gone in a way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, and (almoſt) untrodden, and hath a peculiar excellency in him, which others have not. For his chief ſcope is, after a ſhort and yet full Analyſis and Expoſition, to collect choice and pithy
<pb facs="tcp:169976:3"/>Obſervations out of every Chapter. And in this undertaking he is very happy, and I may truly ſay, another <hi>Mr. David Dickſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though the work it ſelf is ſufficient to commend the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, yet becauſe there are many in our dayes that <hi>prize Books for their Authors ſake, not Authors for their Books ſake;</hi> I was deſired to write ſomething to make this Reverend Miniſter known to this Nation, unto which he is altogether a ſtranger: And for this purpoſe I have received teſtimony concerning him, from thoſe whom I dare truſt, that he is a <hi>man of ſingular parts,</hi> and deſervedly in high eſteem in his own Country, for his <hi>Learning, Godlineſſe Modeſty, Peaceableneſſe</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> That he was earneſtly intreated by ſome of his learned Brethren, (eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> where he is Miniſter) to make this work pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for the good of the Churches in both Nations. The truth is, the Book it ſelf repreſents him to the world in a very <hi>fair and beautiful Character:</hi> For it comprehends much in a little, breathes out much of God and godlineſſe. His Obſervations are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſuitable, and ſometimes ſo unexpected, and yet ſo natural, that I verily beleeve they will be very acceptable, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to private Chriſtians, but alſo and eſpecially unto Miniſters, affording them many rare and unthought on Doctrines, for the ſpiritual edification of their Congregations. That which was ſaid of <hi>Socrates, That whoſoever know him loved him, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him; and they that did not ſo, it was becauſe they did not know him;</hi> may truly be ſaid of this Book: They that know it, wil prize it, and the Author of it; and they that do not ſo, it is becauſe they do not know it. My prayer to God ſhall be, that the learned and religious Author of this ſhort and brief Commentary upon theſe ſix Prophets, may finde ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his endeavours herein, that he may be much encouraged to make a further progreſſe in this way, and other able men may be ſtirred up by his example to do the like upon other Scriptures, which no doubt will tend much to the glory of God; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and edification of his people.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:169976:4"/>place their happineſſe in them, neglecting God the only fountaine of true felicity; as the creature cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the expectations of ſuch, nor ſatisfie their vaſt deſires; ſo do they, by their way, provoke the Lord to diſcover unto them the folly of their choice, whether in mercy to his owne, that hee may traine them up to better things, or in juſtice to the wicked, who ſeek after no more, that they may be no better for all their endleſſe endeavors, then they who voluntarily mortifie their affections to thoſe things; and that all may ſee the folly and madneſſe of their way, who ſell their ſouls, and ſpend out their mony and ſtrength for that which is no bread, and doth not profit nor ſatisfie.</p>
            <p>And albeit this way of attaining felicity, hath beene eſſayed and not found by him, who for outward enjoyments had cauſe to ſay, <hi>What can the man do that cometh after the King?</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>2.12.</hi> And albeit experience in all ages doth diſcover what a ſandy foundation they build upon, who ſeeke by theſe meanes to ſatisfie their own ſouls, made after the image of God; yet how few are they who will believe this truth, till they alſo eſſay it themſelves? <hi>This their way is their folly, yet their poſterity approve their ſayings, Pſal. 49.13.</hi> Yea, when our ſelves are finding this truth verified, we do hardly truſt our owne eyes and ſenſes, but are ſtill ready to imagine that we may find it yet otherwiſe; or if we be put from that hope, yet oft times are we little the better, but do ſit downe in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, as if all felicity were loſt, if we find it not where we expected it; and thus do we neglect the true remedy of our gievances, and do provoke God to <hi>conſume our dayes in vanity, and our years in trouble,</hi> Pſal. <hi>78.33.</hi>

            <p>How great cauſe then have wee to admire and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the folly of the children of men, who do ſo farre miſtake, and upon their miſtake do forſake their own mercy, whereunto they are led by the diſcovering of the emptineſſe of all things beſide God? who do quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the wiſe and holy diſpenſations of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a foundation might be laid for much good, if they were wiſely conſidered; when yet their quarrellings can availe or help them nothing: and who doe not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch diſpenſations for the end for which they are appointed, but either ſit downe stupidly under them, or grow the worſe that paines are taken on them, or at least doe pine away under the puniſhment of their iniquity, and <hi>do howle upon their beds for corne, and wine, and oyle, but return not to the moſt High? Hoſ. 7.14.16.</hi> And on the other hand, we have cauſe to admire the mercie of God toward his own cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones, in that he will (ſo to ſay) make them happy againſt their wils, and when they would deſtroy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves with a vaine ſhew, he in mercy to them wil famiſh their idols, and drive them from ſnares, as he did <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodome.</hi> And when the Lord hath dealt ſo hardly with them, as many times in their bitterneſs they want language to expreſs it, yet he wil let them ſee their miſtake, by giving them meat even out of that eater, and by ſetting them on work to mind their country more, and to <hi>ſee the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments exceeding broad, when they have ſeene an end of all perfection. Pſal. 119.96.</hi> And he will diſcover the riches of his grace, and fulneſs of his ſpiritual comforts, by making his people bleſs him, and acknowledg the mercy of theſe diſpenſations, which ſomtimes they ſo much ſtartled at. <hi>Pſal. 119.71, 75.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do here preſent thee with an Expoſition of ſome of the leſſer Prophets; concerning which, and my undertaking thereof, I do in the entry give this briefe account.</p>
            <p>As I have looked upon a ſhort Expoſition of holy Scripture joyned with the principal doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines flowing there from, after the mould of the Reverend Mr. <hi>David Dickſon,</hi> his late peece upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> as a ſpecial means (through Gods bleſſing) for promoting of truth and piety, and for preventing of errours; ſo I little thought to have undertaken any ſuch thing my ſelf, when ſo many godly, able, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Miniſters of the Goſpel, did not, (for reaſons knowne to themſelves) put hand to it: But being ſome yeers ago ſeriouſly invited with divers others, by the Reverend Author of that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on <hi>Matthew,</hi> to concur with him in proſecuting that purpoſe which he had begun, and hath ſince made further progreſs into, upon the booke of Pſalmes; I did then eſſay ſome of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, being at that time recommended unto me, and of late at his deſire (living now through Gods providence in one City) I have looked upon them over again, and adventured to preſent theſe to publick view, if ſo be it may invite others who have more ability and leiſure, to mind and help forward ſuch a work upon the whole Bible: which is a ſtudy (beſide the profit the Church of God might reape thereby) I am confident, wil richly recompence the undertakers in their own boſome by many advantages.</p>
            <p>As this recommendation did determine me to the choice of theſe Prophets in this undertaking: ſo this narration may ſhorten my account concerning the mould of this piece; ſeeing I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed my ſelf (ſo far as my weakneſs could reach, or the nature of the ſubject, being oftentimes very dark and obſcure, would admit)
<pb facs="tcp:169976:6"/>to the mould followed in the Expoſition upon <hi>Matthew</hi> formerly mentioned. I have found it neceſſary (beſide a ſhort ſumme of each Chapter in the entrie) to premit ſome ſhort Expoſition of the words before the doctrines, which is inlarged, when neede is, in clearing the deductions of each Doctrine. In the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have pointed, upon occaſion, at other Scriptures helping to cleare the place; but for the Doctrines, I did not ſet my ſelfe to bring Scripture confirming them, it being my deſire that no more be admitted, or received here, then ſuch as clearly flow from the text in hand; only where a paſſage occured to memory, for illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine, I have added it, as affording further ground of meditation to the Reader, if he pleaſe. It cannot be a voided in a piece of ſo many Doctrines, and on divers ſubjects, but the ſame Doctrines, at leaſt for ſubſtance, wil occur often; but the Reader may conſider, that every time it occurreth, it is confirmed of new, from a new ground; and Gods inculcating of truths often calls on us to heare, and conſider them much. If any man thinks the doctrines ſometimes more prolixe, he would conſider, that in this ſort of writing it is required to ſay much in little bounds, that ſometimes two truths flowing from one ground, wil ſpeak more fully being conjoyned, then if every one of them were made a doctrine alone; &amp; that ſome doctrines, nakedly propounded, could not ſatisfie, unleſſe they were either limited, or cleered a little.</p>
            <p>As the Doctrines wil be found (I hope) to ariſe naturally from the text explained: ſo in expoſition I have ſtudied to keepe by the rule of faith, and ſet downe that Expoſition which is moſt agreeable to the context it ſelfe: and where diverſity of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations could agree together, as tending to one ſcope, I have conjoyned them; and but ſeldome held forth divers and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent interpretations of one place, where there was no ſuch affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity betwixt them. There is onely one thing of which I would premoniſh thee in a word, and that is concerning ſome promiſes made not only to the Church of the Jewes, but to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wherein not only their future converſion, but their reſtitution to their own land ſeeme to be held forth. I am not ignorant how peremptory many have beene of old, and of late, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of ſuch future events from the Word; and that many who have aſſerted the reſtitution of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their land, have aſſerted with it alſo a reigne of Chriſt, not onely in his ſpiritual government, but in his perſon alſo on earth; and that the Church ſhall be in a very flouriſhing and glorious eſtate for a
<pb facs="tcp:169976:7"/>thouſand yeers. Both of which aſſertions, as they have no ſure footing in Scripture: ſo the firſt ſpeaks but little comfort to the Church (which is that they intend in it;) for, ſeeing Chriſt hath a circumſcribed body, he can be but in one place at once; and it is more comfortable to the Church in all quarters of the world, to be governed by his Spirit, and inſtruments employed by him, ſitting at the Fathers right hand, then by deputies imployed by him, while he remains in one corner of the world, as that opinion muſt grant he will. And for the ſecond, albeit the Church may (and belike after the converſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wil) have ſome glimpſes and breathings of tranquillity and proſperity, yet that happy condition which many ſpeak of, ſeemeth not to be very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent even with common ſenſe; for, if the Church and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Saints, ſhall have corruption while they are within time, that fire will neceſſarily produce ſparks of trouble; and how any trouble can be conſiſtent with ſuch a condition as theſe men ſpeak of, I ſee not. The experience of the Jewes at the firſt coming of Chriſt, and of the Church in all ages, may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently clear, how much carnal conceptions of the glory of Chriſts Kingdome have been diſappointed, as ſavouring too much of fleſh. Yet in this buſineſſe whereof I ſpeak, this would ſeeme (at leaſt) probable; that as many paſſages ſcattered in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whatever they foretold to the Nation of the Jewes at the firſt coming of Chriſt, or ſay daily for the comfort of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſpirit; yet have not their full accompliſhment till all <hi>Iſrael</hi> be converted, as the Apoſtle cleareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. who citing a more obſcure place to cleare it, doth warrant us to make uſe of others that ſpeak more clearly: So there are alſo many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Prophets, which however they may be applyed to a ſpiritual reſtitution of every true Church, and of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit; yet in their full accompliſhment, ſeeme to take in the reſtitution of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and this interpretation ſeemeth not to want Chriſts owne warrant, where he ſaith. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24. <hi>They ſhal fal by the edge of the ſword, and ſhal be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captive into all Nations, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhal be troden down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled,</hi> where he ſeemeth to ſet the ſame term-day to their Captivity, and the deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (including the land) that the Apoſtle ſets to their converſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26. And indeed, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wil be National, as is clear, not only from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. but from <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. where they are foretold, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that they ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:169976:7"/>neither have a true nor falſe religion in their exile, which muſt be underſtood of them taken as an incorporation, and Nation, (for as private men they have ſtill ſome Religion wherever they are) and conſequently their converſion, <hi>ver</hi> 5. muſt be National; If, I ſay, their converſion wil be National, it is agreeable to right reaſon that they wil get a Land for habitation, as a Nation, and what Land more expedient, then their own (though not now any more typical unto them) which God gave to their fathers of old? and which there are ſo plain promiſes (as would appear) for? And for a taſte, any that pleaſeth may conſider on theſe paſſages, ſpoken not only to <hi>Judah,</hi> but to <hi>Jacob, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iſrael, Jer</hi> 30.13, 18. and 31.17. <hi>Ezek</hi> 37.16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.9, 10, 11. and many others; which I wil not now inſiſt to name, or diſcourſe upon; only as I take no pleaſure in ſingular opinions, nor to be peremptory in thoſe things, which time wil be the beſt commentary unto; ſo there being ſo much to this purpoſe ſpoken in the Word, I could not but briefly point at ſuch paſſages in any of theſe following Prophets as ſeeme to tend that way, that ſo the godly may be ſtirred up to pray more earneſtly for the converſion of Iſrael, at which time the Lord, by performance, wil give his own commentary to theſe and many other promiſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhal detaine thee (Chriſtian Reader) no longer in the entrie, but to adde this, that if this piece prove acceptable, and may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Church of Chriſt, I purpoſe (the Lord continuing life, and aſſiſting me) to follow with the reſt of the ſmal Prophets in the ſame Method; provided that ſome others, more fit, do not take the work in hand.

            </p>
            <p>And it cannot be denied on the other hand, that in the midſt of this great wrath, the Lord remembreth his tender mercies towards us, by continuing hitherto the open preaching of the offer of his contemned grace; and by ſtirring up from time to time, the ſpirits of ſundry of his ſervants, to open ſtill more and more clearly the little book of holy Scripture, by pious and

As the Lords judgements upon enemies are not readily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen or expected by them; ſo when they come, they are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be remarked: ſo much doth this <hi>Behold</hi> import. 4. Things undertaken by God, and foretold by him in his Word, ought to be reckoned as certain as if they were already come to paſſe: <hi>I made thee ſmall: thou art deſpiſed,</hi> ſaith he; Whereas yet it was but in his purpoſe, and not accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 5. To be ſingular in afflictions or judgements, or in the meaſure of them, addeth to the weight, and renders them more grievous: for <hi>to be ſmal among the Heathen,</hi> or Nations, implies not only that <hi>Edom</hi> was reckoned among the Heathen Nations, not of the Church, but that God by his judgements ſhould make him one of the ſmalleſt of them, and that none ſhould be ſo far brought under as he; and this is told him as an aggravation of his ſtroke. 6. As the Lords ſhewing mercy upon any makes way for mans mercy towards them alſo, in ſo far as may be for their good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.12. So when the Lord becomes a party in anger, mens affections and reſpects will dry up; for however <hi>Edom</hi> was eſteemed of before, yet when God dealeth with him, <hi>he is greatly deſpiſed.</hi>

                  <p>For further confirmation of the judgement, the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth and amplifies the former ſentence, from ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, overturning all their vain confidences wherewith they were puffed up, as ſuppoſing to be exempted from the ſtroak by them. Whereby alſo the Lord partly diſcovers their pride and conceit becauſe of theſe, to be one of the cauſes of his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie againſt them; and partly alſo he explaines further the judgement to come upon them, by threatning to pull down eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe confidences, and ſo make them completely miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contemptible. The firſt vain confidence, is the ſituation of their hilly Country, and their Cities built upon inacceſſible rocks; of which (as of the reſt) they were intolerably proud, as conceiving their Country to be inacceſſible, and their Cities to be invincible: Againſt which the Lord threatens, that though they dwelt as high as the Eagle builds her neſt, yea, as the Stars toward which Eagles mount, yet he ſhould reach them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe them, and ſo their Country ſhould be invaded, and their cities taken. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Outward advantages and accommodations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with a natural heart, uſually do produce pride, ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; inſolency, for <hi>Edom</hi> whoſe <hi>habitation is high, is proud; and ſaith in his heart, Who ſhal bring me down to the ground?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a renewed heart in all theſe is poor, and dependeth on God. 2. The Lord judgeth of mens pride, no: ſo much by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage, which may be masked over with a ſhew of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as by looking to their heart, and diſeerning the conceit and loſty imaginations that reign there; He eyeth <hi>the pride of Edoms heart.</hi> 3. Of all the deceits that men are eſſayed with, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving is one of the greateſt, when they are given up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude themſelves with vain imaginations and confidences; <hi>thine heart hath deceived thee.</hi> 4. As pride and conceit, however it muſter up mens excellencies before them, is but a deluder, and makes a ſhew of what will prove nothing; as being either an evidence of being nothing in reality, or that what they conceit of, is blaſted and withered: ſo in particular, however preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promiſe great things to make ſinners ſecure, and contemne Gods threatnings; yet it doth but deceive and feed with vain hopes; and will prove a deceiver in the end, when there is moſt need of what they promiſed: <hi>The pride of thine heart hath deceived, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Pride in the creature is looked upon by God as a party
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169976:12"/>againſt him, as ſtriking eminently at his glory in not depending on him, and as affecting his throne, and therefore provokes God, though there were no other quarrel or enemy, and ingages him to prove his power in abaſing it. Therefore that general defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Who ſhall bring me down to the ground?</hi> is anſwered by God, as eſpecially concerned, <hi>I will bring thee down, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 6. The Lord is able to reach man, and bring him down in his moſt eminent ſtrength and greatneſſe imaginable; and cannot only make ſtrong holds a vain refuge in a day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but is able to overturn more confidences then man can build up for his own ſecurity: <hi>To dwell in the clefts of the rock,</hi> is but a ſmal thing for Gods power to reach, and yet it was the height of that which <hi>Edom</hi> had to boaſt of; for, <hi>Though thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thy ſelf as the eagle, and though thou ſet thy neſt among the ſtars, thence will I bring thee down.</hi>

                  <p>A ſecond vain confidence is their wealth and treaſures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men uſe to help themſelves in their extremities.

Riches treaſured by thoſe whom God hath a quarrel at, are ſo far from helping or delivering them in a day of wrath, or from doing the owners good, that they are juſtly given as a prey to their enemies: <hi>Edoms things an ſearched out and ſought up.</hi> 2. As the children of the Lord art to read the mercy of their trials by conſidering how moderate they are in reſpect of judgements upon enemies; ſo the wicked may ſee the ſeverity of God in what their ſtroaks are beyond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: for this end is <hi>Edoms</hi> ſpoiling ſet before him, as being beyond what <hi>theeves and robbers by night</hi> uſe to do, who uſe not to take all away, but what may ſuffice; as not being able to carry all,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169976:12"/>or not daring for fear to ſtay and ſearch out all: and beyond what <hi>grape-gatherers</hi> do in vineyards, who according to the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.10. or, becauſe they cannot reach all with their eye, do ſtill <hi>leave ſome grapes;</hi> whereas <hi>the things of</hi> Eſau <hi>are ſearched out, and his hidden things ſought up.</hi> 3. The ſtroaks that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſuch as not only live wickedly, but alſo turn enemies and perſecutors of his Church, are complete, and far beyond the ordinary viſitations that come upon the children of men: This compariſon betwixt <hi>Eſau</hi>'s ſtroak, and robbers their picking imports, that the one had been in ſome ſort a mercy and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in reſpect of the other. 4.

                  <p>The third vain confidence is the help of their confederates, the Narions round about them, and eſpecially <hi>Egypt,</hi> whoſe intereſt it was to engage the <hi>Edomines,</hi> who lay in their frontiers, againſt the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> The Lord threatens to make theſe the occaſion and inſtruments to promote their ruine, for all their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſhould engage them to oppoſe the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> at the border of their Countrey, which was in effect to caſt them out of it; as the phraſe alſo in the Original ſignifies; their friends and intimate familiars by ſubtilty and fair pretences ſhould enſnare them to run on their own hurt and ruine, as if they had given them a bed to lye on, and yet hid a dagger in it, with the point upward, to ſlay them. And this is more fully cleared by reading the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169976:13"/>words thus (as the Original h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th it, without addition of any words which are put in the Tranſlation) <hi>They have laid thy bread a wound ander thee:</hi> ſignifying, that their bread which they had from <hi>Egypt</hi> was the ſnare that drew them on their ruin. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. According to the ſin of a Perſon or Nation, ſo ordinarily is their judgement; for <hi>Edom</hi> broke off that brotherly amity that ought to have been betwixt his brother <hi>Jacob</hi> and him, therefore he is peid in his own coine, his heathen confederates are his ruine. He ſinned in breaking bonds, and he is plagued in that other bonds break him, and are broken to him: <hi>All the men of thy confed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie have brought thee even to the border, &amp;c.</hi> 2. God can make thoſe to be inſtruments of ſinners ruine, who in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance are very near friends; and can make confederacies wherein men conſide, the ſhort cut to their deſtruction: <hi>Edom</hi> was ruined by <hi>his confederates, and the men that were at peace with him.</hi> 3. The confederacies and alliances of politick men, are not to be truſted in, they being led only by their own State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſts, and not minding their benefit with whom they carry faireſt, but only their own advantage; for ſo did <hi>Edoms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, <hi>The men that were at peace with him, deceived him,</hi> they gave him <hi>bread for a wound under him,</hi> to put them betwixt themſelves and the dint of the enemy. The fourth vaine confidence is, their wiſdome and prudence, whereby they might think to manage their affairs dexterouſly, and to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as it ſeems they have been famous for this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.7. Concerning this the Lord foretels, that for all their wiſdom, they ſhould not be able ſo much as to diſcern and prevent the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of their confederates: And that becauſe the Lord would, when they were ready for the ſtroak, deprive them of wiſdom, either by taking away ſuch as were wiſe, or turning their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into folly. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord hath ruine to bring upon a people, their wiſdome and policy will not avert it. He can deprive men of wiſdom to manage their affairs, he can make the wiſeſt to be over-reached and out-witted, and can make what they think their wiſeſt courſe, prove greateſt folly in the iſſue; for <hi>Edom</hi> is wiſe, and many confederacies ſeemed a wiſe courſe to ſtrengthen themſelves; and yet in all this, <hi>there is no underſtanding in him,</hi> to diſcern the ſnares in it. 2. That wherein men are moſt eminent, and are ready to conſide moſt in, will prove vain when they have moſt need, that the pride of all glory will be ſtained; for, <hi>The wiſe men are deſtroyed out of Edom, and underſtanding out of the mount of Eſau,</hi> who were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169976:13"/>a wiſe people. Excellencies confided in are a diſadvantage, 3. Whatever wiſdome or excellencies be in men, they are all Gods gift and dependent on him, who gives or takes them away at his pleaſure, and according as he hath a people to raiſe or to ruine; for, <hi>He deſtroyeth the wiſe men</hi> when he will. 4. Mens wiſdom and prudence is ordinarily looked upon by God as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to him, and ground of a controverſie, in regard that mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their wiſdom is the cauſe why they give God little to do; &amp; acknowledg not his providence, but take all upon themſelves; for this queſtion, <hi>Shal I not, ſaith the Lord, even deſtroy the wiſe men out of Edom?</hi> imports, that there is ſome neceſſity for his doing of it, and that their wiſdome may not eſcape without a ſtain. 5. It is a ſingular demonſtration of Gods Soveraignty and providence in the world, when he overturns the wiſdome of the wiſe, brings all their well-contrived projects to nought, ſnares them in their own works and counſels, makes eminent fooles of them, and cauſes them to reel like drunken men, who were in reputation for wiſdome; for, <hi>When there is no wiſdom in him,</hi> the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth himſelf the Author of it, that we may ſee his hand in it, and give him the glory of it, and may believe his power to do the like when the wiſdom of Adverſaries is the Churches fear: <hi>Shal I not, ſaith the Lord, deſtroy the wiſe men, &amp;c?</hi> 6. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the threatnings of Gods Word may oftentimes ſeeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable when they are pronounced, yet in the Lords time the accompliſhment will be remarkable: for albeit <hi>Edom,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Lords threatning, retain his former wiſdom, (the Lord in his holy providence enſnaring wicked men ſo, who do contemn threatnings, when they are not ſpeedily executed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.15.) yet, <hi>In that day,</hi> to wit of his calamity, <hi>ſhal I not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the wiſe men, ſaith the Lord?</hi>

                  <p>The fifth vain confidence is, their valour and ſtrength, for which alſo that Nation was eminent, as living by the ſword, according as was foretold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.40. concerning this, the Lord threatens to confound with terror, the mighty men of their Country, or ſome part of it, moſt renowned for valiant men, and called <hi>Teman,</hi> from <hi>Eſan</hi>'s Grandchild, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.15. or from its ſituation Southward (as the word ſignifies) from <hi>Judea.</hi> And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169976:14"/>ſo theſe being laid by, there ſhould be an univerſal ſlaughter of the inhabitants of the Country, at leaſt of every one of note (as the word in the Original ſignifies, and is tranſlated ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.2. and 62.9. and elſewhere) as was uſual for the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to do where they prevailed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Natural men are in a ſort endleſs in their carnal confidences, and hard to be put wholly from them; but when one fails they will have another to flye to; Therefore is all this paines taken to ſhew the vanity of <hi>Edoms</hi> refuges, who if the ſituation of his Countrey faile him, hath treaſures to gather forces with; and failing that, confederates; or if they be wanting, prudence; which hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered people in great extremities; and if he, be yet put to it, he hath <hi>mighty men</hi> to run on all hazards.

The terror of God is ſufficient to cruſh and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the mightieſt of men; mans valour is not terror-proof, when the terrour is from God; <hi>Thy mighty men, O Teman, ſhall be diſmayed,</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> with terror, as the word alſo ſignifieth. 3. As terror upon a people is an ordinary forerunner of great deſolation; <hi>Thy mighty man are diſmayed, and every one of the mount of Eſau cut off by ſlaughter:</hi> So where the Lord hath a judgement to go through a Land, no probable or promiſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture will turn it away, but what would hinder it ſhall be made uſeleſſe: <hi>The mighty men ſhall be diſmayed,</hi> to the end that he may reach his purpoſe, and <hi>cut off every one, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord having pronounced ſentence againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> proceeds to ſhew the equity thereof from the cauſe procuring it, upon which the ſentence is again repeated. In general, Gods quarrel againſt them, is for their violent carriage towards <hi>Judab,</hi> for which they are again threatned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lord doth not ſtrike a people, but where he hath a juſt quarrel; ſo the ſtupidity of men, in not laying ſin to heart, and their blindneſſe and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love is ſuch, as Gods quarrel will not be taken up till himſelfe diſcover it; Therefore doth the Lord himſelf here reveal it. 2. Of all the injuries and evil deeds committed by wicked men, none are ſo remarked, or ſo ſuddenly and ſeverely puniſhed as the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169976:14"/>injuries they do to the Church and people of God; The Lord threatens <hi>Edom</hi> for <hi>violence againſt Jacob,</hi> as if he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no other fault, and as filling his cup ſpeedily. 3. The Lord will not forget enemies their intereſt in, and obligations to the people of God whom they oppreſſe, that thereby he may ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their guilt, and double their puniſhment; Therefore the Lord reckons <hi>Edoms</hi> kindred to <hi>Jacob,</hi> that his unnaturalneſſe might appear, and to be a ground of the ſentence, <hi>Thy Brother Jacob.</hi> 4. Much ignominy and ſhame is abiding thoſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who ought to be friends, and are foes to the Church of God; partly in that they ſhall be diſappointed of their expectation to ſee the Churches ruine, and partly in that judgements from God ſhall make them baſe and contemptible, if not alſo confound them with horror, that they ſhould have taken part againſt the Church with thoſe who ruine themſelves; for, <hi>ſhame ſhall cover Edom,</hi> when he is deſtroyed by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> with whom he joyned againſt <hi>Judah.</hi> 5. Judgements upon the troublers and enemies of the Church, are without moderation and hope of recovery, as coming from the hand of Juſtice, and of a jealous God; <hi>Thou ſhalt be cut off for ever;</hi> for, however there may be ſome relenting under this or that particular ſtroake, yet (unleſſe that repentance prevent) juſtice makes what they get but an earneſt of more, and purſues them to all eternity, as this ſtroake of <hi>Edom</hi> is expounded, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.4.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169976:15"/>full of bitterneſſe and calamity; for here <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers carry away their forces, enter the gates</hi> by force, <hi>and caſt lote upon Jeruſalem,</hi> or divide their prey by lots, as <hi>Joel</hi> 3.3. <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.10. 2.

                     <hi>Edoms</hi> violence is yet further deſcribed by ſhewing negatively, what he ought not to have done, and yet did; to wit, that in the day of <hi>Judah</hi>'s calamity by the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> he a brother, who is borne for adverſity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. ought not to have looked on their condition with delight, nor inſulted and ſpoken blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly againſt God and his people, (as this is expounded, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35.12, 13.) not entred the City with the enemies, and ſpoiled them of their goods, nor have laid wait for ſuch of the Jewes as fled, to cut them off, or deliver them into the enemies hand. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The houre of the Churches trial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is a very ſharp, dark, and violent blaſt: <hi>It is a day of calamity, deſtruction and diſtreſs, a day wherein he becomes a ſtranger;</hi> That is, not dealt with as a priviledged people, but as ſtrangers, and ſent to a ſtrange Country in exile, and were exerciſed with ſtrange lots. The Churches heinous ſins, and Gods jealouſie over his confederate people cauſeth this; and withal, the Lord mindeth to haſte over the Churches affliction, and therefore ſends it thick on. 2. The Church of God ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much, muſt not therefore think to be exempted from more trial; but muſt, by what they ſuffer, be taught ſubmiſſion to yet further exerciſe, if the Lord will: For <hi>Judah</hi> in their <hi>diſtreſſe and calamity,</hi> muſt yet have more from <hi>Edom.</hi> 3. However wicked men walk after the luſts and paſſions of their own hearts, and ſtick at nothing which they will, and have power to effect, yet the Lord will let them know, that they ſtand obliged by a Law to duty, the violation whereof he will remark, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and puniſh: For though <hi>Edom</hi> ſatisfied himſelf and his paſſion, in what he did againſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> yet the Lord tells him, <hi>thou ſhouldeſt not</hi> have done thus and thus, but waſt obliged by the Law to do otherwiſe, being both a brother and a neighbour. 4. To adde affliction to the afflicted, is great cruelty, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it is done by thoſe, from whom comfort might in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be expected: <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that he became a ſtranger, &amp;c.</hi> This adds to <hi>Edoms</hi> ſin, that he choſe ſuch a time wherein to let out his hatred. 5. As a careleſs or greedy look on the affliction of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169976:16"/>people of God, as it were a pleaſant ſpectacle, is a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their triall and affliction: So it is <hi>Eſau</hi>-like, and the badge of a reprobate condition, to take pleaſure in ſuch a ſight: For, it is twice marked, that hee <hi>looked on the day of his brother;</hi> (as an evidence of his cruelty, in adding that to their affliction: See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.17.) 6. As rejoycing of enemies, and their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt God, his truth, and his peoples priviledges in him, is an uſuall and ſore triall of the Church, when ſhe is in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So it is the badge of wicked men to become inſolent with ſucceſſe, and a cauſe wherefore God will plead with them: For it is another challenge, as for great cruelty, that <hi>Edom rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over Judah in the day of their deſtruction, and ſpoke proudly in the day of diſtreſſe.</hi> 7. The Lord will not forget the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures done by any to the Church, even when greater wrongs are in doing to them, which might ſeem to hide the leſſer; For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Caldeans were now bringing all to ruine; yet the Lord takes notice of an inſolent eye, proud looks, <hi>entering into the gate, and laying hands on ſubſtance.</hi> 8. Apoſtates and falſe brethren are moſt cruel enemies and perſecuters of thoſe whom they deſert; For, <hi>Edom</hi> the brother, beſide all his inſulting and joyning with the enemy, did yet more, and <hi>ſtood in the croſſe way to cut off thoſe that did eſcape;</hi> and <hi>delivers up the remnant,</hi> when it ſeems, the Caldeans had given over. 9. Even when God is afflicting his Church, and letting looſe the reins to the fury of men againſt them, yet he doth not quit his intereſt in them: For, in the midſt of all this ſtorm from the Chaldean and Edom, the Lord gives them the Covenant-title, <hi>My people,</hi> as not onely ſtanding unrepealed, but forth-coming for much ſympathie from God, and a reaſon why he thus pleads their cauſe; Sin may procure affliction, but every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation will not make void the Covenant.</p>

                  <p>The Lord repeats the threatning, and ſheweth that whereas no brotherly obligation, nor ſenſe of duty to God had moved <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to deſiſt; yet there is another reaſon more touching, why he needed not be ſo inſolent: becauſe the heathen ſhould have their day of it, and that ſhortly, and particularly <hi>Edom;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt with God to recompence their injuries done to the Church: and as his people had drunk of the cup of affliction; ſo to make <hi>Edom</hi> with others, drink of his judgment to their owne deſtruction. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God by his univerſal providence, is Sovereigne Lord and Judg of all men, even of thoſe who know him not, nor acknowledge him, to take trial of their wayes and puniſh them; for there is <hi>a day of the Lord upon al the heathen,</hi> a day of judicial cognition and recompence, and a day wherein he will prove himſelf God upon them. 2. The Lords correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Church, is a preſage and pledge of vengeance to come on the world and enemies: for, when <hi>Judah</hi> is in diſtreſſe, <hi>the day of the Lord on all the heathen is neer: when they have drunk, the heathen ſhall drinke.</hi> 3. The Lord will not be owing his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies any thing for afflicting his people, but will pay them in their own coin, and make them Scholars at the Schoole they bred the Church with: For, ſuch is <hi>Edoms</hi> doome, <hi>as thou haſt done, it ſhall be done unto thee, thy reward ſhall return upon thine own head.</hi> 4. No external priviledge exempteth a people from fflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it is for their good, and their ſinful temper calleth for it; <hi>Ye have drunk upon my holy mountain,</hi> ſaith the Lord to <hi>Judah.</hi> 5. It is the Churches advantage to get the firſt eſſay of tryals and judgments, that they may be eaſieſt unto them, the cup of Gods wrath having ſtill, the neerer the bottom, the more dregs, which are reſerved for the wicked, to deſtroy them: For, <hi>They have drunk upon my holy mountaine,</hi> and yet are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſpoken to; but <hi>the heathen ſhall drink continually, and ſwallow down, and be as if they had not been;</hi> that is, utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. 6. The Lords correcting of his people is a meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear them the more to him, and make them more precious in his eyes: For this ſentence againſt the Heathen, is directed by way of encouragement to the Church, (<hi>as ye have drunk,—ſo ſhall the heathen,</hi>—) to comfort and aſſure her, and make her confident of his good will, in that he will avenge her quarrell.</p>

                  <p>The reſt of this Prophecie contains comfortable promiſes unto the Church now in trouble, whereof however <hi>Judah</hi> had ſome taſte at their return from the Captivity, and afterwards; and albeit the Church of the Goſpel begetting continual performance of them in a ſpiritual way; yet (ſome of them at leaſt) ſeem to point more eſpecially at the time of the converſion and ſaving of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 11. In this Verſe there is promiſed to the Church deliverance and evaſion from her troubles; holineſs, and wonted priviledges, and reſtitution to their wonted poſſeſſions; not onely of the Jews, to what they were deprived of by the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, but of the whole <hi>houſe of Jacob,</hi> to what was given them by Covenant, made with their Fathers, which is yet unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord in the time of the Churches trouble, withhold from her the poſſeſſion of her pleaſant things; yet his thoughts and purpoſes of love are then as large and ſure to her as ever, as ſhee may read from the Word, though ſhe ſee it not in diſpenſations: therefore the time of <hi>Judah</hi>'s trouble is a time wherein he makes many promiſes. 2. Not only is there in the greateſt arflictions of the Church ſtill ſome to eſcape, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible ſhe ſhould totally periſh: but the Church may expect compleat deliverance from all her evils in due time; For <hi>upon Mount Zion ſhall be deliverance.</hi> 3. Holineſſe is the unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companion of bleſſed deliverance, and is a means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it to the Church: for when there is deliverance, <hi>there ſhall be holineſſe.</hi> Holineſſe is an evidence of Gods dwelling in the Church, who will eſtabliſh his own habitation; and a token that God will preſerve them as his conſecrated people, and not ſuffer them to be profaned and polluted with invaſion of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as formerly: And thus alſo <hi>Holineſſe</hi> is ſometime to be taken, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.1. as the fruit of the Holy Lords dwelling among them, and ſetting them apart for himſelfe, and as the free reward of their ſtudying Holineſſe. 4. Holineſſe is not only the Churches duty to ſtudy after it, but as the Lords promiſe, who undertakes to work it in her: For, it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>There ſhall be holineſſe;</hi> they ſhall be an holy people, enjoy Gods preſence in holy Ordinances, and be preſerved from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of enemies. 5. The mercies of the Church, whether ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or temporal, in ſo far as God hath promiſed, and they need them, are ſure, and ſuch as will be recovered after they have been ſuſpended from the comfort and uſe of them for a long time: For, <hi>the houſe of Jacob ſhall poſſeſſe their hereditary poſſeſſions,</hi> (as the word is) after long captivity and exile.</p>

The Church of God will never want inveterate and cruel enemies, nor difficulties, while ſhe is in the world: For, not only <hi>Iudah</hi> in the time of their Captivity, but the Church in her reſtauration by Chriſt, <hi>and the houſe of Iacob and Ioſeph,</hi> (which takes in all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the ten Tribes expreſly,) when they ſhare of this deliverance, have <hi>an houſe of Eſau</hi> againſt them. There is no time wherein the Church hath corruptions, but ſhe is to look for difficulties in it. 2. Oppoſition of enemies unto the Church, doth but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to make way for Gods letting out many proofs of his love in helping and delivering her, as this promiſe doth teach. 3. Oppoſition to the Church, is a certain pledge of the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of oppoſers, and the Lord is able when he pleaſeth, to make his weak people ſtrong to bring it about: For this promiſe that <hi>Iacob ſhall be a fire, &amp;c.</hi> imports not only that <hi>Edom</hi> ſhall be utterly conſumed as a flame conſumeth ſtubble; but that their medling with the Church ſhal be cauſe of their ruin; as if ſtubble indeavouring to put out a fire, were burnt it ſelf; or that God ſhould make the Church active to effect it, as was in part accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed when the Jewes after their captivity deſtroyed the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> as Hiſtory recordeth. 4. The Word of God, and his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency and fidelity who ſpeaks it, is ſufficient to confirm the Churches faith in the certainty of moſt improbable things: For, whatever unlikelihood be in this promiſe, it is removed by this; <hi>For the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>

Now concerning the accompliſhment of this promiſe, it cannot be ſaid that any thing done by the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and their ſucceſſors, or obtained by <hi>Herod</hi> and his ſucceſſors from the Romanes, was the full performance, theſe things coming far ſhort of what is here foretold; beſides, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or ten Tribes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned in this Prophecie. Nor doth the taking the place in a ſpiritual ſenſe fully exhauſt the meaning, there being ſuch expreſſe deſignation of places to be poſſeſſed, and of ſeveral troups of captives to poſſeſſe the ſeveral places; And therefore it ſeems to point further at the reſtitution of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their own land, and the inlargement of their border, when they ſhall turn to Chriſt in the latter dayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26. However the Promiſe may teach us: 1. The afflictions of the Church, through Gods bleſſing, tend to their advantage and gain; For the Captivity are to get not only their own land, but the <hi>mount of Eſau and the Philiſtines,</hi> and what they had not before their Captivity. 2. Chriſt in his Church will gain ground on his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and poſſeſſe and reign over them, either by their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry converſion, or violent ſubjection and deſtruction: For ſo much doth the ſcope of this promiſe, being ſpiritually taken, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. 3. The priviledges of the people of God are irrevocable and immurable, and will break forth in comfortable fruits after long and ſad interruptions. This is again ſignified and taught by <hi>Iſraels poſſeſſing the fields of Ephraim, and Semaria, and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169976:18"/>with Gilead</hi> (as the Original hath it) of which they have been ſo long deprived. 4. The Lord marketh every diſtreſſe, and captivity of his people, and what becomes of them; and may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt much of his goodneſs to ſuch as he hath ſore afflicted, and brought down with corrections: For though the <hi>Captivity</hi> was ſent away with much ignominie, and carried far off; yet the Lord marks that they are the <hi>captivity,</hi> and where they are, and will reſtore them to their poſſeſſions, and cauſe them to poſſeſs the gates of their enemies.</p>

The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Church of God, is Salvation eternal and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alſo, in ſo far as is fit for her to receive: Therefore are the inſtruments ſent to her called <hi>Saviours;</hi> to wit, in an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental way. 3. The Doctrine of the Goſpel in the mouth of Chriſts Servants, doth reprove, judge and condemne the world, and all the enemies of Chriſt, and this judgement is ſeconded with ſpiritual plagues, and ſometimes temporal, till the day come when the World ſhall judge them, and they receive a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete recompence according to it. Thus do ſome of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments <hi>judge the mount of Eſau.</hi> 4. As the Lord is Soveraign in all the world, even over his enemies: So when he raiſeth up inſtruments for the Churches good, he will bleſſe them, and by them bring his enemies to an account, and execute his ſentence againſt them; For theſe inſtruments of the Churches tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169976:19"/>deliverance do <hi>judge the Mount of Eſau,</hi> when God delivers enemies into their hand as his delegates to pour his vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

                     <p>But Jonah roſe up to flie unto Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa, and he found a ſhip going to Tarſhiſh: ſo be paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the LORD.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here we have <hi>Jonah</hi>'s diſobedience to this call, he being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with the novelty of ſuch a charge, and fearing hazard, or want of ſucceſs, or as may be gathered from Chap. 4.2. that if either on their repentance, or in Gods long-ſuffering, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould not be executed, he might be reputed a falſe Prophet, and ſo be expoſed to contempt, (whereof the Prophets of God had many trials in <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8, 18. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.11.) Therefore he reſolves to flee from God to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> in <hi>Cilicia;</hi> not that he denied his univerſal preſence in all the world, but (as the original bears) <hi>He fled from before the face of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169976:20"/>Lord,</hi> that is, from the land where God uſually manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Prophets, and from obeying the Lord, as a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant flying from his Maſter, in whoſe preſence he uſeth to ſtand. And this reſolution he followeth, and finding at <hi>Joppa</hi> a ſhip, he ſets to the journey, it being ſafer and nearer to travel by ſea then by land. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is an uſual fault in men to examin Gods command by their owne wiſdome or will, and accordingly as they judge, to obey or diſobey; for, ſo doth <hi>Jonah</hi> here, <hi>He roſe up to flye, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo do all they, who look more to ſee a reaſon of Gods commands ſatisfactory to them, then to the will of the Commander. 2. Even the precious ſervants of the Lord have ſo much unmortified corruption, as (being left to themſelves) may drive them on in very high fits of diſobedience; For <hi>Jonah,</hi> a Prophet, doth avowedly reſiſt the will of God. 3. Rebellion in the children of God may not onely be a ſudden tentation or a fit ſhortly ſhaken off, but they may go on long in it, and with great deliberation; for, <hi>Jonah</hi> all the while hee was going to <hi>Joppa,</hi> fraughting the ſhip, and launching out (by all which the Lord tryed his abiding by it) continueth in his reſolution. 4. Men in their rebellion are ordinarily ſo addicted to their own will, that they are blinde and inconſiderate, not pondering any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that may enſue, but will hazard all, rather then be croſſed in their purpoſes. This doth appear in <hi>Jonah;</hi> hee who knew the Lord will diſobey him, and yet think to proſper; hee will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe that great priviledge of ſtanding before the Lord, to receive prophetick revelations, then want his will, which is twice marked, to ſhew his great madneſſe: yea, hee will rather be at charges to <hi>pay the fare,</hi> and hazard to Sea with Pagan men, then goe among Pagans at Gods command. 5. Succeſſe in a way of rebellion againſt God, is a ſnare, leading on the rebell to ſadder corrections; Therefore <hi>Jonah found a ſhip ready,</hi> and opportunity to launch out, that he may get a ſharper rod at ſea, where Pagans ſhould be witneſſes, and not <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

To be in company with wicked men, or with men in a wicked way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, is dangerous, and may involve the ſociety in hazards with them; for, <hi>the ſhip was like to be broken,</hi> and all the reſt in danger of periſhing with <hi>Ionah.</hi>

                     <p>Then the Mariners were afraid, and cryed every man unto his god, and caſt forth the wares that were in the ſhip into the ſea to lighten it of them: but Jonah was gone down into the ſides of the ſhip, and he lay and was fast aſleep.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the next place we have ſome effects and conſequences of this tempeſt, by which at laſt Gods purpoſe in it is brought forth: The firſt effect upon the Mariners is fear, ſtirring them up to do all that is uſual in ſuch deſperate caſes for their own relief, both ſuch means as they accounted divine, in calling on their gods, and ſuch as were humane, in caſting out of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to lighten the ſhip; all which is amplified from <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, who in the mean time was ſleeping. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God can ſhake, and by trouble will ſhake the hearts of ſtouteſt men, and make them fear; for, <hi>the Mariners,</hi> otherwiſe ſtout at ſea, <hi>are afraid.</hi> 2. Men may be afraid, and much exerciſed about troubles, whom yet the Lord intends not to hurt by them; for, <hi>the Mariners are afraid</hi> of the ſtorm, ſent out to purſue <hi>Ionah,</hi> and not them, however they had their own groſs ſins. 3. Even natures light may teach men to aſcribe ſingular effects to the hand of a Sovereign Lord, and that without acknowledging thereof, there can be no ſafety in eminent dangers; for ſo doth theſe Pagans practice teach us, while in their fear they <hi>cried every man to his god.</hi> 4. As natures light in corrupted man will miſlead him in taking up the true God; ſo when men turn their back upon the true God and the knowledge of him, they become vain in their imaginations, and endleſs in their ſeeking out of falſe gods and confidences; therefore among Pagans, even in one ſhip, there are more falſe Gods then one worſhipped; <hi>They cryed every man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169976:21"/>to his god.</hi> There is no certainty when the true God is forſaken. 5. Although men ought not to be unwilling to yeild up their life to God, when or whereſoever he in his providence ſhall bee pleaſed to call for it; yet life is ſo precious, that nothing world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſide, is too dear to be employed for preſervation of it: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures light teacheth this to theſe Mariners, who <hi>caſt out the wares that were in the ſhip,</hi> to eſſay if that could be a means of preſerving their life. 6. Ordinarily thoſe who are moſt guilty, and whom affliction is pointing at, are moſt ſecure under it; for, all this while <hi>Jonah</hi> the guilty man <hi>was faſt aſleep.</hi> 7. The conſcience of a renewed man may, after it is wounded by a groſſe ſin, be a very dead and ſtupified conſcience for a time: for, <hi>Ionah</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Maſter, in the midſt of the ſtorm <hi>lay faſt aſleep,</hi> and <hi>was gone down to the fides of the ſhip</hi> for that end. 8. It is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for guilty conſciences to think to ſhift and ſleep away challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without eſſaying the true remedy; for <hi>Ionah</hi> in his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <hi>was gone down to the fides of the ſhip,</hi> to ſleep away his trouble.</p>

                  <p>To the end the Lord may diſcover the guilty man, and cauſe of this tempeſt, as he made the Mariners ſenſible themſelves, ſo the Shipmaſter is ſet on work to waken <hi>Ionah,</hi> to try his intereſt with his God (whom they knew not yet to be the true God) if poſſibly he had more power or good will to ſuch as worſhipped him, then theirs had: Which is the firſt ſtep to his diſcovery. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A childe of God may ſometimes miſcarry ſo far, through infirmity, negligence and tentation, that even a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by natures light, may ſee him reproveable and blame-worthy; for ſo is <hi>Ionah</hi> reproved by the ſhipmaſter, <hi>What meaneſt thou? &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is deeply cenſurable and abſurd, even to natures eye, to be ſecure in trouble: <hi>What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper? ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Variety of falſe Gods hold men in great ſuſpenſe and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; therefore every man <hi>having cryed to his god,</hi> ver. 5. yet they are not ſetled, but will have <hi>Ionah</hi> to eſſay his God, if he be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the reſt, <hi>Ariſe, call upon thy God;</hi> ſo much alſo doth that doubtful ſpeech, <hi>if ſo be that God will think upon us,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169976:22"/>&amp;c.</hi> import in this place, in part. 4. Natures light will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he who is the true God, hath power to deliver in moſt extreme dangers; for in this great tempeſt, they aſſert it: <hi>If God think on us, we will not periſh.</hi> 5. Howſoever in a calme day, nature conceit and boaſt of merit, yet in a ſtrait even natural men are forced to have their recourſe onely to the favour of God; for theſe Pagans have no ground of hope that they ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but <hi>in Gods thinking</hi> (or <hi>being bright and ſhining,</hi> as the word ſignifies, that is, looking favourably) <hi>on them.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſecond effect of this tempeſt tends to a further diſcovery of <hi>Jonah</hi> to be the guilty man. Hee being awaked and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his ſin, the tempeſt continues notwithſtanding all they had done. Therefore the mariners, in ſtead of ſearching every man into himſelfe, that all might take with guilt, and finde favour, begin to ſuſpect that God was purſuing ſome notorious guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſome of them, and none voluntarily confeſſing it, they reſolve with common conſent to ſeek it out by an extraordinary way of lots. Wherein whatever fault there was, yet Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordered it ſo, as the lot fell on <hi>Jonah,</hi> to awake his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Nature may lead men ſo far as in great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to take up ſin to be the cauſe thereof; for ſo much doth this conſultation import, which however it was true in this caſe, and it be alwayes true that ſin is the root affliction ſprings from; yet nature uſes not to goe ſo far as to lead men to lay ſin to heart in common and ordinary croſſes, or to look on common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſins as provocation ſufficient to bring on ſaddeſt tryals; for they muſt ſeek ſome ſingular cauſe here; far leſſe to look on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as tryals of faith, or for preventing of ſin. 2. Men in nature uſe not ſo much to take up, and be ſenſible of ſin, from the law of God having authority in their heart, as grope it in ſome tryal and difficulty: Therefore they of whoſe ſenſe of guilt we heare not before, do now in their trial begin to think <hi>for whoſe cauſe this evil is.</hi> 3. Prayer never ſo much eſſayed in a day of diſtreſſe will not availe, till ſin procuring it be ſearched out and taken with; ſo much do theſe Pagans acknowledge, while with the former meanes of prayer, they ſet themſelves to ſeek out
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169976:22"/>the guilty, and to knowe <hi>for whoſe cauſe this evill is upon them.</hi> 4. Afflictions ſharply purſuing, may have ſuch efficacy as to put men, otherwiſe careleſſe, to it, to ſeek out ſin, and not let them ſleep on who gladly would, and have been inſenſible of ſin; for, theſe men are ſo put to it, as they are willing to have the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ſought out, and to ſubmit themſelves to a lot for that effect: <hi>They ſaid every one to his fellow, Come, and let us caſt lots, that we may know, &amp;c.</hi> Afflictions will <hi>command</hi> men to turn from iniquity, who would not hear ſuch a charge in any other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Job</hi> 36.10. 5. The Lords all-ſeeing eye perceives every ſecret ſin, and his providence over-rules moſt contingent and uncertain events, and holily ordereth the raſh actions of men ſo, as to bring about his own purpoſes by them: For, theſe men acknowledg that the guilty is known, though not to them, and that the determination of a continge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> lot over-ruled by a Deity, is a true evidence for whoſe cauſe this evil is. And albeit it was a fault in them not to ſearch every man himſelfe, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult by lots without ſpecial warrant; yet God over-ruleth the lot to diſcover <hi>Jonah.</hi> 6. The Lords controverſie is ſometime greater and more ſeverely proſecuted againſt his own children for their miſcarriages, then againſt Pagans and groſs Idolaters among whom they may be; Therefore, <hi>the lot,</hi> guided by God, <hi>fell upon Jonah,</hi> ſignifying his rebellion to be the cauſe of all their danger, rather then their Idolatry, though openly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the height of their ſtreight: for, 1. Rebellion is as Idolatry, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. and ſo much the groſſer, as it is in a child. 2. Albeit they worſhipped that which was no god; yet none of them had ſo behaved themſelves toward a ſuppoſed Deity, as he had done toward the true God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10, 11. 3.

                  <p>The guilty man being now diſcovered by God, is examined by the Mariners to find out the particular fact, but very diſcreetly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169976:23"/>as ſuppoſing that poſſibly the ſin might be ſomewhat whereof his Nation and people were guilty, and not any particular guilt of his own. And therefore concerning himſelfe they enquire of his calling and journey, if ſo be they might be unlawful; and of his countrey and people, if ſo be they were accurſed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men have need of full information, before they give out ſentence upon any; for, though <hi>Jonah</hi> was taken by a lot, and theſe men not knowing him, might in paſſion ſhortly have rid themſelves of him, who had been the occaſion and cauſe of their trouble; yet they will farther informe themſelves, and that very meekly; <hi>tell us, we pray thee, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Charity, even in refined nature, doth not eaſily admit of an hard conſtruction of any, or without ſure grounds; Therefore they firſt enquire, <hi>tell us for whoſe cauſe this evil is upon us,</hi> as deſiring to be more particularly informed, and not being willing to hold him for a wicked man in his own perſon, till they ſhould heare further. 3. As in mens callings, employments, country and people, there is hazard of ſin; ſo by thoſe circumſtances, much of mens faults may be found out: Therefore is <hi>Jonah</hi> poſed concerning all theſe; For, beſide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful callings, and places where it is not lawfull to haunt, every particular countrey and people have their own tentations to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins, from which ſins of a generation or calling, it is hard to keep free. 4. Men do oftentimes, following their own ends, engage in courſes without all conſideration, till a day of trouble ſet them to trace them back and make enquiry: For, theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, minding their own gain, put none of theſe queſtions to <hi>Jonah,</hi> when they tooke him aboard, till the ſtorm led them to ſee their folly and raſhneſſe. 5. The Lord, in purſuing for ſin, knowes how to order challenges, ſo as may make ſin moſt bitter to the guilty; Therefore doth he order the Mariners mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of theſe queſtions, <hi>What is thine occupation? &amp;c.</hi> every one of which might be a ſting to <hi>Jonah's</hi> conſcience, that he, a Prophet, ſhould be fleeing from God; coming from the holy land and the Church, ſhould be rebellious and purſued rather then Pagans; that he ſhould be on a way and not have a warrant from God for it, &amp;c.</p>

A ſinner truly humbled will be ſenſible of the huge deſert of ſin, and will ſubmit and reverence the righteouſneſſe of God in ſaddeſt puniſhments: Therefore <hi>Jonah</hi> counſels, <hi>Take me up, and caſt me into the ſea;</hi> not out of any bitterneſs, or hatred and wearineſſe of his own life; but from a Prophetick ſpirit, knowing Gods mind, and from the ſenſe of ſin, acknowledging the equity of the ſentence in his conſcience. 4.

                     <hi>Jonah</hi> having pronounced ſentence againſt himſelf, the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners execute it; but firſt out of compaſſion toward him, they uſed their utmoſt endeavours to get to any land by rowing; but to no purpoſe, for God made the ſea fight againſt them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they pray and proteſt, that their executing of the ſentence might not be imputed to them as blood-ſhed, he being innocent in reſpect of them: and what they were now to do, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken only in obedience to Gods Soveraigne providence and will revealed by <hi>Jonah</hi> himſelf. And on theſe conditions they proceed to execution, upon which followeth their deliverance from their ſtrait. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Even humanity in natural men will be tender and compaſſionate towards thoſe who are in trouble, though juſtly procured; eſpecially if they know them to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, and to be ſenſible of their condition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore albeit <hi>Jonah</hi> had been the cauſe of their trouble; yet looking on him as a Prophet of God, and pitying him when they heard his confeſſion and ſentence againſt himſelf, <hi>they rowed bard to bring it to land,</hi> and would trouble themſelves to exempt him. 2. Even refined nature hath an antipathy againſt blood-ſhed, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, if in juſtice it could be avoided: This appears in their endeavours and earneſt proteſtations before they execute a juſt ſentence. 3. The utmoſt endeavours of men will not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the purpoſes of God, nor free a guilty ſinner from his ſtroak: For, <hi>they rowed hard</hi> to exempt him, <hi>but the ſea wrought, and was tempeſtuous againſt them,</hi> as purſuing him, and them alſo, if they did not what God revealed to be their duty. 4. God in his Sovereignty diſpoſeth of all things at his pleaſure and will: This do they acknowledge and ſee in this ſentence, <hi>Thou, O Lord, haſt done as it pleaſed thee.</hi> 5. Extremeſt neceſſities give no latitude to men to do any thing, but what is warranted of God; For they judg that no neceſſity could free them from the guilt of innocent blood in caſting out <hi>Jonah,</hi> but only Gods revealed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169976:25"/>will: For, ſay they, as a reaſon, <hi>Thou, O Lord, haſt done as it pleaſed thee.</hi> 6. Men are to go about actions in obedience to the Sovereign will and pleaſure of God revealed to them, which otherwiſe their inclinations are much averſe from: For, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Lords will, <hi>They took up Ionah and caſt him forth,</hi> much againſt their own hearts. 7. As God is a ſevere chaſtiſer of rebellion in his own deareſt children: ſo rebellion againſt him deſerves that the Rebel ſhould be cut off in a violent way, and that the Lords earth or ſea ſhould not carry him: For, ſo is <hi>Ionah caſt forth into the ſea.</hi> 8. The execution of juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the guilty in a ſociety, is a means of turning away judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the reſt; For, <hi>Ionah</hi> being caſt forth, <hi>the Sea ceaſed from her raging.</hi> See <hi>Pſ</hi> 106.30.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>All thoſe paſſages are amplified from an effect they had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mariners, who abſerving all that was done, and having no doubt heard <hi>Ionah</hi> preach more of God, then is recorded, (as appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 10.) are moved to tremble and fear the true God, and teſtified it by ſacrificing unto him, (whether preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they being as yet ignorant, or at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,) and making vowes for the future, belike, that they would dedicate themſelves to God, and profeſſe the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In one work the Lord may have more holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes then one, and beſides what we ſee, may be doing many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: For, while he is purſuing <hi>Ionah,</hi> he is alſo ſetting forth himſelf, and preaching his power and juſtice to Pagans, when <hi>Ionah</hi> refuſed to go to <hi>Nineveh</hi> and do it. 2. The Lord can in a ſhort time, and by few means, produce ſtrange effects and changes upon the children of men, even although they had not heard of him before: For, however it cannot certainly be determined, whether theſe Mariners were indeed converted, or whether it was <hi>Ionah</hi>'s Doctrine revealing God, and miſery, and mercy, or their apprehenſion of God in this work, that wrought moſt upon them; yet this is certain, that this ſhort while of the tempeſt and calm, and <hi>Ionah</hi>'s preaching, made a great change: <hi>The men feared the Lord exceedingly, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As the Lord can eaſily make up mens loſſes which they ſuſtain in his providence;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169976:25"/>ſo it ish is way ſometimes to make up temporal loſſes with ſome ſpiritual advantage: So theſe men, whoſe ſhip and lives were in hazard, and their goods loſt, are made up, in that they had a Prophet among them, and are brought to know ſomewhat of the true God, which made it a rich voyage. 4. The Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations among a people, eſpecially when they are accompanied with any thing of his Word, calls for their improving them to ſome ſpiritual advantage; ſo much doth their practiſe preſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, while by conſidering on what they ſaw, felt and heard, <hi>they feared the Lord exceedingly.</hi> 5. God rightly conſidered and taken up, as he hath revealed himſelfe, and as he appeareth in ſome ſpecial acts of providence, is exceeding dreadfull, and to be ſtood in aw of: For, <hi>they feared</hi> him <hi>exceedingly.</hi> 6. It is not a ſufficient proofe of mens getting the fruit of Gods diſpenſations toward them, when they onely affect and draw to ſome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of him for the preſent, but grow negligent for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: This they acknowledge in their practiſe, <hi>they offered a ſacrifice unto the Lord, and made vowes,</hi> for the time to come, and engaged themſelves to God.</p>

When God is purſuing the rebellion of his children in a moſt ſevere way; yet doth he not altogether caſt off his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy toward them, but out of the abundance thereof, moderates their affliction: For, <hi>The Lord,</hi> purſuing <hi>Jonah, had</hi> yet <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a great fiſh to ſwallow him up.</hi> 2. Gods providence over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules and directs the motions of irrational creatures and Sea-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as pleaſeth him: For, <hi>the Lord had prepared a great fiſh, &amp;c.</hi> whereas it knew nothing but to range up and down in the Sea, and ſwallow him as any other prey. 3. God may have a mercy, and proofe of love waiting upon his people, in a time and place where it would be leaſt expected: For, <hi>Jonah</hi> meets a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the heart of a raging Sea, into which hee is caſt in anger, as to be deſtroyed. 4. Albeit the mercy of God will not deſtroy his guilty people in their afflictions; yet his wiſedome ſeeth it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169976:26"/>not fitting at firſt totally to deliver them, but will have their faith exerciſed: For, <hi>Jonah</hi> is here arreſted <hi>three dayes and three nights</hi> between hope and perplexity for his further exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. 5. God can, when he ſeeth fit, preſerve his people from ruine in an incredible and miraculous way: Therefore <hi>Jonah</hi> is not only <hi>ſwallowed</hi> whole by the fiſh, not being hurt by its teeth; but is preſerved in the <hi>belly of the fiſh three dayes and three nights,</hi> where he was in hazard of choaking for want of breath, or of being digeſted by the fiſh into its own ſubſtance.</p>

Unto the childe of God afflictions are nothing to beare, in compariſon of Gods diſpleaſure, who afflicts, and of the tentations, which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him as a party doth raiſe; for his affliction is imbittered with this, <hi>Thou</hi> being angry, <hi>hadſt caſt me into the Sea: all thy billowes, and thy waves,</hi> (not onely raiſed by thee in the Sea, to purſue me a rebel, but tides of toſſing tentations, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the ſenſe of thy diſpleaſure,) <hi>paſſed over me,</hi> ſo that hee could doe no more then be overwhelmed, and run downe with one of them after another. 4.

It is the uſual lot of the Lords children, to have not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169976:28"/>onely outward afflictions to wreſtle with, but ſpiritual tentations and ſad concluſions, gathered from their troubles, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The children of the Lord in their troubles, may be ſo toſſed and divided betwixt hope and deſpair, that faith and unbelief will be taking word about; for, ſo doth <hi>Jonahs,</hi> experience teach; <hi>I ſaid. I am caſt out, yet wilt I looke again.</hi> 3. In a time of tentation, unbeliefes word is ordinarily firſt out, till faith come and correct it; ordinarily what is ſaid in haſte is unbeliefes language, and to be un-ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for, this comes firſt out, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> 4. A child of God may not only be aſſaulted with fits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, but for a time be overcome with it, and yield to it, and yet for all that recover his feet again; for <hi>Jonah</hi> once concluded, and ſaid, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> 5. As it is ordinary under tentation, to judge of all Gods reſpect, care and love, by our ſenſe of his preſent dealing: ſo to be caſt off by God, as one that he will not favour nor care for, nor take notice of, is the foreſt of trials, eſpecially to the childe of God, who lives by Gods favour, and is made up in all his afflictions, when he findes that God thinks on him, and that his troubles indear him to Gods care; for this is <hi>Jonahs</hi> apprehenſion and ſaddeſt complaint; <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> 6. It is no new thing to ſee a childe of God, and veſſel of mercy apprehending re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and rejection from God, in his ſad and darke houre; for, this alſo is <hi>Jonahs</hi> temptation. 7. Nor is it ſtrange to ſee the children of God exerciſed, and ſadly afflicted with that which hath never been, nor will be, ſave in their own feareful apprehenſions; for, ſo is <hi>Jonah</hi> with <hi>caſting off.</hi> When we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by our own deſervings, and by probabilyties in a ſtrait, and not by Gods love and all-ſufficiency, we cannot but draw ſad concluſions, and our own ſpirits will make us work enough. 8. Tentations, even when they have overcome for a ſeaſon, are not to be lien under, and given way to by the children of God, but ought to be reſiſted and ſet againſt, though they ſhould (if it were poſſible) periſh in the attempt, this being the way to honour God and get deliverance; for vanquiſhed <hi>Jonah</hi> will not quit it ſo; <hi>Yet will I looke again.</hi> 9. That whereby the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord muſt oppoſe all troubles inward and outward, and reſiſt tentations, is naked ſaith, cloſely adhering to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace made in Chriſt, and gathering hope of better dealing; this is imported in his <hi>looking again toward the holy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169976:28"/>Temple,</hi> or eying God in his Covenant, whereof that was a ſigne. To caſt away confidence as uſeleſſe in a ſtrait, or not to eſſay faith till wee be hired by ſenſe, or to lie by in wilfull unbelief, thinking that is the way to get ſenſe, to looſe our doubts; or to ſeek any footing for faith but in Gods Covenant and free grace in Chriſt, is the height of folly. 10. The weakeſt act of faith may do much good in a day of greateſt need; For, in all this extremity <hi>Ionah</hi> had no more but a <hi>looking again,</hi> as a poor baniſhed man. 11. Faith in a time of need will finde a way through many a dark impediment to meet with God; Therefore <hi>Ionah,</hi> incloſed in the ſea, and not knowing where the Temple (toward which they were to pray) ſtood, will ſet faith at need to ſeek it out. 12. It ſpeaks much of Gods praiſe, that when his people are laid by with their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yet hee will not loſe them, but recover them out of their deepeſt ſwounes, and make vanquiſhed faith yet again to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over difficulties, which they had judged inſuperable; For, this is alſo recorded to his praiſe, that not onely <hi>Ionah</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered crying when his trouble was great, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. but that hee was ſtrengthened after hee had once yeelded to the tentation, to believe and <hi>look again.</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169976:29"/>the fiſh ranged with him, as ſo many barres, would have held him as in a perpetual priſon. All which grounds of feare he here recordeth, to ſet forth the mercy of God; who when neither depth of ſea, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſenſe of an afflicted and ſad condition is not ſoon to be forgotten, but to be kept freſh, and carried along with every ſight of mercy: therefore did the Lord ſuffer <hi>Jonah</hi> to take a ſecond view of his condition, and <hi>Jonah</hi> by his rehearſall of it, teſtifieth that he is yet more ſenſible what he had been without Gods help. 3. The more we ſtudie the difficulties of our afflicted conditions, we will ſtill ſee more reaſons wherefore wee ſhould admire and magnifie the Lord in his delivering of us: For, after his former ſenſible ſight of his troubles, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. when hee takes this other view of it, hee ſees yet more (as trouble without eying of God is endleſly difficult) of impoſſiblities to be delivered without God. 4. It is the Lords way with his people to let them ſee their difficulties to be paſt hope and irrecoverable, before hee appear for them, that he may be the more eminently ſeen; for, <hi>Jonahs</hi> aggravation of his trouble from hazard of life, depth of ſeas, and ſteepneſſe of ſhore, doth import that in his eys deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was impoſſible. 5. Whatever be the fears and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Saints under their troubles, yet in due time all that they will have to ſay of greateſt trials, is, that they have made way for Gods manifeſting himſelf in them: therefore is that ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſubjoyned to his hopeleſſe trouble; <hi>Yet haſt thou brought up my life.</hi> 6. Albeit the Lord would have his people enjoying an eſcape in the midſt of their trouble, in living by faith, and will have faith tryed, how it will follow its look; yet it is his way alſo when he ſees it fit, and hath tryed their faith, to refute all their doubtfull thoughts with reall deliverance: therefore after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer breathing, <hi>ver</hi> 4. and <hi>Jonah</hi>'s freſh aſſault, hee gets actuall deliverance to end the controverſie. 7.

The portion of ſuch as ſeek happineſſe in God and in his way only, is mercy, and what mercy (in ſo all-ſufficient a God) can afford. Therefore men taking another way, <hi>forſake mercy,</hi> that is, their happineſs, flowing from the infinite mercy of God: all happineſſe to loſt man being mercies gift. 6. Men by forſaking of God can take nothing from him, but all the prejudice redounds to themſelves; for, <hi>they forſake their owne mercy,</hi> but do not deprive him of happineſſe. 7. Men in their forſaking of God or his way, can have no juſt challenge or ground of exception againſt him, as putting them away, but muſt take all the blame upon themſelves; for it is <hi>their own mercy</hi> which they forſake; <hi>their own,</hi> I ſay, by offer; for God, notwithſtanding his ſecret purpoſe, yet ſecludeth not any from mercy to whom the offer is made, till they ſeclude themſelves.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169976:31"/>brought back to obey the will of God, is to bee acknowledged as a mercy, and matter of praiſe; for, ſuch is the ſubject of <hi>Jonah's</hi> ſong, compared with the former verſe; he will bleſſe the Lord not onely for deliverance, but, that (though to his own coſt) he had not been permitted to proſper in a wrong way. 3. Praiſe is that true ſacrifice pointed at in the law, by the thankſgiving-offerings in the Temple; therefore doth hee give unto praiſe the name of what ſhadowed it out, <hi>I will ſacrifice with the voice of thankſgiving.</hi> See <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13.15. 4. The truly godly under the law were taught of God, not to reſt upon theſe outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances and offerings, but to preſſe and ſeek after the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duty and ſubſtance, and to make uſe of Chriſt in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone even our beſt morall actions are accepted; therefore doth hee hold forth that <hi>the voice of thankſgiving</hi> (or affectionate praiſe) was the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> indeed. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.30, 31. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. And withall the joyning of ſacrifice with the voice of thankſgiving, ſheweth, that his praiſe was offered up in and by that true ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. 5. The Lords people in their afflictions and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, will be made to ſee great neceſſity of making vowes, and binding themſelves more firmely to their duty; for, <hi>Jonah</hi> in his trouble had vowed, <hi>that that I have vowed;</hi> which was a binding of himſelfe with his owne conſent more accurately to obſerve and follow the will, and Commandements of the Lord: the reaſon of which ingagement is, becauſe they will find when it comes to ſtrait, much ſhort comming, and little fervour in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary walking, which needs upſtirring; they will find alſo much obligation layd upon them, by the Lords mercifull remembring of them in trouble, voluntarily to take on his yoke; and much ſenſe of their owne inſtability, needing ſuch bonds and tyes. 6. It is the duty of the Lords children, being delivered, not to forget their condition in trouble, nor their reſolutions and obligations following thereupon, as if once being out of trouble, they were out of Gods reverence, but to ſtudy to walk anſwerably in their calme day, to that they reſolved upon in greateſt extremity; therefore, ſaith <hi>Jonah, I will pay that that I have vowed.</hi> 7. Salvation and deliverance of all kindes is Gods perogative royal; none can ſave, or give peace when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands trouble, and he hath the prererogative to ſave and deliver, when reaſon, probability, the ſentence of the law, and all things elſe have condemned and given over for loſt, and in deſpite of all oppoſition whatſoever. And it is the duty of ſuch as have had any experience of this, to cleave to it as an undeniable truth in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169976:31"/>al following extremities: For, <hi>Jonah</hi> having found this in his preſent caſe, layes it down as a fixed ground of faith in all extremities, that <hi>ſalvation is of the Lord:</hi> the force of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word comprehending ſalvation, both temporal and eternal.</p>

The Lord, by the afflictions of his people, is but ſchooling and bettering them, and not ſeeking to deſtroy them; whereof he can give proofe in ſetting them in freedome and ſafety from deadly dangers and extremities: For, <hi>Jonah</hi> being humbled, <hi>The Lord ſpake to the fiſh, and it vomited out</hi> Jonah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2.

In the ordinary paths and motions of creatures, God may be bringing about eſpecial purpoſes and providences; as this fiſh is made to <hi>vomit out</hi> and deliver <hi>Jonah,</hi> when it is minding no ſuch thing, but tumbling to and again; much more may it be ſo in the ordinary wayes of men, as in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's</hi> going to <hi>Bethlehem, Luke</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.5, 6.</p>

                     <hi>JOnah</hi> being now humbled for his rebellion, and delivered from his affliction, is again called to go and preach againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> it being needful to have his calling repeated, leſt if he had gone on the firſt call, which he had diſobeyed, it might have tared with him as with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who reſenting their own diſobedience would go up to the Land, but without the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.40, 41. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The ſervants of the Lord ought to ſtick cloſe by their commiſſion, and faithfully to publiſh it, without adding or diminiſhing; for, ſo is <hi>Ionah</hi> commanded, <hi>Go unto that great city, and preach the preaching that I bid thee.</hi>

                  <p>In the next place we have <hi>Ionah</hi>'s obedience, wherein alſo is recorded a deſcription of the greatneſſe of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> which was of three dayes journey in circuite, or if one would go through all the ſtreets of it; and a brief ſum of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which for a whole day (going from place to place, as God directed him) or going through a third of the City (it being in whole three dayes journey) he proclaimed; whereby we are neither to underſtand that he preached no more of the cauſes procuring this judgment, or of God, in whoſe name he threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the reſult of all was, that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor yet that he preached no longer, nor in any more of the City during the forty dayes: but the meaning is, that before he got any further, his word took effect with thoſe that heard it, and by their means, with the reſt of the City, as appeares, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. Obedience to God in a calling and commanded duty, is a ſure evidence of an humbled man; for, <hi>Ionah</hi> before rebellious, now <hi>aroſe and went to</hi> Nineveh. 2. It is our duty to obey the will of God, not becauſe of our inclination, but with an eye to his command, to whom our wile and inclinations ought to ſtoop; unto whom we ſhould ſtudy to approve our ſelves in all things, and from whom we may expect help in following his way; for, <hi>Ionah</hi> went to <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh, according to the word of the Lord,</hi> as being now taught to look more to God's will then to his own. 3. Gods ſervants following his Commandment, and truſting in him, have been and will be enabled to oppoſe and denounce vengeance againſt the wickedneſs of greateſt perſons or places; for, albeit <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh was an exceeding great city, &amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>Ionah cried</hi> with zeal and courage, <hi>and ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> 4. God is able to reach and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrow greateſt perſons or places, when he proſecutes a controverſie againſt them; for <hi>Ionah</hi> in his name denounces, that <hi>Nineveh</hi> that great city <hi>ſhall be overthrown.</hi> 5. The Lord oftentimes ſees it fit in great wiſdome to conceal any thoughts of love toward a people, and hold out only threatnings and ſeverity to induce them more ſeriouſly to repent: for this cauſe is the ſentence abſolute, <hi>Yet forty dayes and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be overthrowne,</hi> without any mention of a condition, that upon their repentance they ſhould be ſpared, as afterward he did only the granting forty days unto them, carries an invitation to repentance in the boſome of it.</p>

                  <p>The ſucceſſe of <hi>Ionah</hi>'s preaching among the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> is, their receiving of the meſſage; and humbling of themſelves before God, which being generally held forth in the 5. <hi>verſe,</hi> is more fully enlarged in the following purpoſe; that the King hearing of this threatning, (belike before <hi>Ionah</hi> came unto him) in his own perſon ſet about the duty of humiliation, and by his Authority with his Nobles ordained a publick Faſt, wherein not only rational creatures, but even beaſts (which they uſed to deck in the time of peace) ſhould for a time be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of food, and clothed with ſackcloth, that ſo by this ſad ſight men might be ſet on edge to cry fervently unto God, and that with their repentance they ſhould joyn Reformation of their evil wayes and oppreſſion. Albeit it cannot be ſaid, that all thoſe who were employed in this exerciſe had true faith and repentance unto converſion (as neither can it be aledged that none were really converted, for <hi>Ionah</hi> did preach much in forty dayes to them (having in ſhorter time taught the Mariners much) yet conſidering that Chriſt calleth it <hi>Repentance,</hi> Matth. 12.41. we may ſafely conclude that there was no groſſe diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in it, but that at leaſt they had legal faith and contrition. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Word of the Lord may, when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169976:33"/>he accompanieth it, have ſtrange and ſpeedy effects among ſuch as men would look for very little from; for, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> are deſpiſing the word, <hi>Nineveh</hi> is ſet on work by it, and that ſo ſpeepily as before <hi>Ionah</hi> had got through the city, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. the work is begun, and report from hearers only ſets others on work. <hi>Word came to the King, and he aroſe from his throne, &amp;c.</hi> 2. To belive the truth of Gods Word, when it is ſpoken, is the ready way to make it effectual, and have place; it being ordinarily ſlighted, becauſe it is not credited; Therefore <hi>Ninevehs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation begins at this, <hi>The people of</hi> Nineveh <hi>believed.</hi> 3. What is ſpoken by meſſengers in the Name of the Lord, muſt be taken up as Gods ſpeech before it can be effected; therefore <hi>the people of</hi> Nineveh hearing <hi>Ionah, believed God,</hi> in whoſe Name he ſpake. 4. Extraordinary cauſes of a people under wrath imminent or incumbent for ſinne, call them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary courſes and remedies for averting the ſame; therefore the <hi>Ninevites</hi> in this ſtrait, count it not ſufficient to uſe an ordinary way of dealing with God but <hi>proclaimed a faſt, and put on ſackcloth, &amp;c.</hi> 5. In a time of great extremity it becomes thoſe, who would approve themſelves to God, ſo to carry themſelves, as may teſtifie moſt ſenſe of the deſert of ſin, their abjection and low condition before the Lord, and ſo as may ſtir us up to earneſt prayer; Theſe things contained in the Kings edict of covering with ſackcloath, and withholding food from man and beaſt, tended to theſe ends; for hereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, how all ſorts had offended God, and abuſed the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unto ſinne; they teſtifie alſo their ſenſe of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the Lord might cut them all off, and their beaſts for their ſake, and that becauſe of this, they were in an abject and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition in their own eyes; and withal, by this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful face of all things, they would ſtir up themſelves to intreat the face of the Lord. As for the external performances, as they were never of any worth, but abominable, if they were reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon without the ſubſtance: ſo they (eſpecially that of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth) were more called for under the ſhadows of the Law, when the Promiſes were not ſo clear as under the Goſpel, and when people were trained on to their duty by that Paedagogie; and as abſtinence is ſtil required in ſolemn humiliations in ſo far as may be ſubſervient to ſpiritual duties, ſo it might be more practiſed in warm Countries then in colder Climats. 6. A lively ſenſe of Gods authority and of his wrath kindling againſt ſin, my make a King quit his throne and robes, and take a place
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169976:34"/>in the duſt with the meaneſt of his ſubjects, to deprecate the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God; for, <hi>The King of</hi> Nineveh <hi>aroſe from his Throne, and laid his robes from him, and covered him with ſackcloth, and ſate in aſhes.</hi> 7. Kings are obliged, not only by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but by their example alſo, to promote Piety among their ſubjects; for, the people having informed the King, he in his own perſon <hi>aroſe from his Throne, &amp;c.</hi> and by his Authority <hi>cauſed in to be proclaimed and publiſhed, &amp;c.</hi> Authority and Law without example will not avail ſo much. 8. Albeit men in Authority cannot compel the conſciences of their ſubjects unto faith and obedience, yet they may by their Authority en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them to perform the external duties of Religion; for, <hi>the King of</hi> Nineveh <hi>made a proclamation and Decree</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whereby he did teſtifie his own repentance, and promote it in others. 9. Men in higheſt Authority are not to rule and do all by themſelves, but with the advice and concurrence of thoſe who ought to have Authority next unto them: for, <hi>He cauſed to be proctaimed by the Decree of the King and his Nobles.</hi> So much did theſe Heathens ſee of humane frailty, even in the greateſt of men needing ſuch aſſiſtance. 10. All external ceremonies and performances of Faſting and putting on of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, are no ſufficient means of averting the anger of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be fervent prayer to God; therefore it is ſubjoyned in the Decree, <hi>And cry mightily to God;</hi> all theſe other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ought to ſtir up to that as the kernel. 11. Prayer, though never ſo apparently fervent, is not acceptable without an endeavour of Reformation.

Senſible ſinners under fears of felt judgments, look on Gods being reconciled with them as the fountain of their happineſs, and from that only can they expect any comfortable iſſue of their calamities; therefore their eye is chiefly upon Gods <hi>turning, repenting, and turning away from his fierce anger;</hi> from which only they can gather hope that they <hi>ſhall not periſh.</hi> 3. Such as are moſt earneſt with God, under the ſenſe of ſin and judgments, will be ready to ſee moſt of his grace and free love in ſhewing favour toward them; therefore all their hope, when they cry mightily, is built <hi>on Gods turning and repenting,</hi> and quitting the controverſie, and that grace and compaſſion muſt be eminently active, if the peace be made up at all. 4. This way of ſpeech, <hi>Who can tell if God will turne? &amp;c.</hi> uſed likewiſe by the Church in like extremities, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.14. doth hold out, 1. That ſenſible ſinners may have many ſad toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings betwixt the expectation of Gods mercy, and the ſenſe of their own deſervings, ſo that albeit the Promiſe be moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to ſuch, yet they can neither ſpeak the pure language of faith, nor yet wholly the language of unbelief, but mixed and made up of both. Therefore albeit it be beyond all controverſie that God will be reconciled with a penitent; and no doubt <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> had preached ſo much concerning God, yet they can attain no further then, <hi>Who can tell if God will turn? &amp;c.</hi> 2 As it is no ſmall difficulty to get free from a ſtroak, where provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are great, and God hath entered in proceſſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely threatned; and as God is not alwayes pleaſed upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to keep off temporal afflictions, when iniquity is come to an height; ſo exemption from them is to be looked for by the penitent, with very great ſubmiſſion, conſidering his guilt; and that happineſſe is not to be placed therein, if God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be reconciled: therefore doth this ſuſpended hope look chiefly (not ſo much to remiſſion, as) to temporal preſervation, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169976:35"/>God <hi>may turne away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not.</hi> 3. The Lord, by keeping our mindes in ſuſpenſe, betwixt hope and diſcouragement, would ſtir up to more diligence; therefore is this doubtfull hope ſubjoyned as a reaſon why they ſhould <hi>crie mightily to God;</hi> and reforme their wayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.4 Such as are convinced of ſin ought not to be deterred from duty, though it ſeemed never ſo hopeleſſe, but ought to reſolve to follow it, get what they will; therefore they will cry to God, though they bee not certaine of deliverance.</p>

                     <hi>JOnah</hi> is diſcontented with this mercy of God toward <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> and expoſtulates with him about it, applauding himſelfe in his former rebellion as having done more wiſely in it, then in following Gods Call: The ground of all which diſtemper was (as appeares,) that God ſparing of <hi>Nineveh</hi> (which it ſeemes he knew by Revelation, or gathered from their repentance, or from the ſtanding of the City after the forty dayes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired) was a ready meanes as he thought to make his Miniſtry, and Gods Name and Authority to be vilipended; or, (as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is full of invention) that ſuch an enemy as they were to be to the people of God, was not cut off. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Corruptions may lurk and remaine alive, in thoſe who have gone through many ſtraits, and ſo might have had them mortified; for, <hi>Jonah</hi> after many difficulties, is yet paſsionate and impatient; <hi>He was diſpleaſed exceedingly, and very angry.</hi> 2. It
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169976:36"/>is a great iniquity in the children of men, to ſeeke to have Gods diſpenſations framed after the molde of their minde; for it is <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſin, to be <hi>very angry and exceedingly diſpleaſed</hi> with what God did. 3. Corruption may ſometimes ſo prevaile with the children of God, that it ſhall not only be a tentation ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, out of love to him, within their breſt, but may alſo break out with their own conſent againſt God for a ſeaſon: for <hi>Ionah</hi> vents his paſſion, <hi>He prayed unto the Lord and ſaid.</hi> 4. Much of that which we vent under the name of prayer, may indeed be our raving in our Feavers, and a letting looſe our corruption and paſſion; for, that is called <hi>prayer</hi> here, which in effect is a bitter expoſtulation with God, and a venting of his paſſionate deſire to die. 5. Crooked wayes, for which the people of God have been corrected, and which they have been made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, may yet again in an houre of tentation be approved and liked of by them; for, <hi>Ionah</hi> applauds himſelf in his former way of rebellion which he had condemned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8. and thinks he had done well; <hi>Was not this my ſaying? &amp;c. therefore I fled, &amp;c.</hi> 6. It is a tentation inſident to <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, to preſume that they would guide things better, if they had their will, then God doth guide them; for, this expoſtulation implies, that he thought it had been better to have gone on to <hi>Tarſhrſh,</hi> then to have come to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> as things went. 7. A perſon under ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will not want his own fair pretences, wherewith he may think to juſtifie his way, and to make it ſpecious and ſeem rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; for, <hi>Ionah</hi> ſeemes to have ſuch reaſons, that he dare appeale to God himſelf, whether he foreſaw not wel in his own Countrey, that Gods mercy would make his threatning to be in vain, and bring his Miniſtry in contempt, and did not wel in flying; <hi>was not this my ſaying,</hi> ſaith he to God? but our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings muſt ſubmit to gods ſovereign wil, and give place to his infinite wiſdom. 8. The mercy of God toward loſt man, is ſo farre beyond mans mercy, that it may ſometimes be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to his tendereſt children, in that he is ſo merciful; for, Gods mercy to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and that he is ſo <hi>gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp;c.</hi> is <hi>Ionah</hi>'s eye-ſore. 9. God is ſo gracious, that as he is not eaſily provoked by ſinners; ſo he is eaſily, when provoked, reconciled againe unto them; for, this <hi>Ionah</hi> knew in his own countrey, that he was a <hi>gracious God, and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſſe, and repented of the evil:</hi> and this did he now ſee veryfied. 10. It is a great miſtake to think that mercy manifeſted to humble ſinners ſhould make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169976:36"/>God or his ſervants, it being a moſt effectual meanes to produce feare of God, and reſpect to his ordinances and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4.

                     <hi>Jonah</hi> ſubjoynes to his expoſtulation an impatient wiſh, that God would take him away by death, ſince hee got not his will, and could not endure the infamy, which he apprehended would come upon him <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Death, (not as it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement from ſin, or a chariot to convey us to the place where we will be with God for ever, but as it takes away from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent imagined or real bitterneſſe) is the ordinary refuge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered ſpirits, and the back-doore unto which, out of impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wearineſſe of life, pride and conteſt with providence, they ſeek; therefore doth <hi>Jonah</hi> now pray, <hi>Take my life from me.</hi> 2. It is the fruit and the evidence of an imbittered ſpirit, that any condition, how ill ſoever, ſeemes better then the preſent caſe unto them; therefore <hi>Jonah</hi> thinkes it <hi>better to dye then live,</hi> without any affectionate eye to glory, but rather having reſpect to his reſt from preſent trouble, (as appeares from Gods repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it,) whereas it ought rather to have affrighted him to think of going out of the world in ſuch a bitter frame. 3. The children of God under tentation, may be very ardent in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the droſſe of their owne heart, and in ſeeking that which is altogether wrong; for, <hi>Jonah</hi> in his paſſion <hi>beſeeches</hi> the Lord to take away his life. Great is the mercy of Saints, in having a Mediatour to reforme their petitions. 4. It is a ſign af great corruption and ſelfe-love in men, to ſeek their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction in dying or living, rather then in theſe to be ſubject to the Will of God; and it is baſeneſſe and cowardiſe, to ſeek paſſionately to be out of this life, becauſe of any trouble we may meet with in it, in our following of God; for, ſuch is <hi>Jonah</hi>'s infirmity, and this is his reaſon in his paſſion: take my life from me; <hi>For it is better for mee to dye then to live.</hi>

The Lord doth in great meekneſſe and patience beare with the infirmities of his ſervants while they are in a diſtemper, and while there is hope of recovery; ſo much doth this gentle reproofe of great paſsion and ſtubbornneſſe teach. And ſo the mercy of God which he envied, that it ſhould be ſhewed to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> is the cauſe of his owne ſafety. 2. Gentle reproofs from God, and his tender dealing with his children, ought to take deepeſt impreſsion upon them: for, therefore doth the Lord chooſe this way, that <hi>Ionah,</hi> ſeeing therein his goodneſſe toward him, who was ſo often out of courſe, might be the more deeply convinced. 3. The children of God, when they cool of their fits, will be moſt ſevere againſt themſelves for their impatiency and miſcarriage; therefore doth the Lord appeal to <hi>Ionah</hi> himſelfe being ſober, to judge of his owne way: <hi>Doeſt thou wel to be angry?</hi> as being the fitteſt Judge to paſſe an hard cenſure upon himſelfe. 4. It is a great iniquity and preſumption in the creature to be angry at, or quarrel with any of Gods wayes, who is abſolute and unſearchably deep in his counſels: for, ſaith he, <hi>Doeſt thou</hi> (a worme, a potſheard, and an owle, who canſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne my wayes) <hi>wel to be ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A child of God under tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be very hard to convince of his errour; and may go on in his courſe, even when God reproves him for it; for <hi>Ionah</hi> thus reproved, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. goeth on, and is intent upon the ruine of the City. 2. Inordinate affections may not onely carry men to ſhew themſelves in oppoſition to the Will of God, but is a ready
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169976:37"/>way to draw them to deluſion, while as men will not believe truth, but according as they fancy and wiſh, ſo will they ſtill expect and look that things ſhould be; for, the forty dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, and <hi>Ionah</hi> being informed of Gods Will, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth the ſatisfying of his deſire; <hi>He went out to ſee what would become of the City;</hi> as judging poſſibly, that ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe day of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s ruine, after the forty dayes, was not fixed, therefore they might periſh yet, or that poſſibly they would give over their repenting; or, that Gods ſentence being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly altered, ſo might his purpoſe of mercy be. 3. Even the children of God, in the houre of tentation, may vent ſuch diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as are monſtrous among men; ſo much of old <hi>Adam</hi> is there in the moſt mortified, and ſo much need is there to pray, that we be not led into tentation: for, whereas <hi>Ionah,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ought to have rejoyced at the ſucceſſe of his Miniſtry, and the repentance of ſinners, his mind is only bent upon the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Penitents, and it is his great eye-ſore to ſee that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtanding; <hi>He ſate to ſee what became of it,</hi> as daily wiſhing its deſtruction, and grieving that he ſaw it not. 4. Smaller contentments and accommodations are to be choſen, rather then greater delights, by abiding in a place where Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are imminent, therefore doth <hi>Ionah,</hi> who expected and wiſhed the ruine of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> well in this reſpect, that he will rather <hi>ſit under the ſhadow of a Booth,</hi> then abide in the City.

                  <p>Before the Lord make uſe of all this to his holy purpoſe, hee challengeth <hi>Jonah</hi> concerning this his diſcontent, that ſo hee confeſſing his paſſion, way may bee made for the reproofe: <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. In every action it is our duty to look on our ſelves as accountable to God for it, and to examine how it is done, whether well or not? for, ſo doth Gods challenge, to give an account, and to examine, teach: <hi>Doſt thou wel, &amp;c?</hi> 2. To be exceſſively diſcontent at Providences, eſpecially for ſmall matters, is a thing no way beſeeming the ſervants of God; for this alſo is imported in the challenge, that it was not right in him, a Prophet, to be <hi>angry,</hi> (yea, <hi>exceedingly angry,</hi> as the words may be read) <hi>for the gourd.</hi> 3. The pride of mans heart is ſuch, that it will juſtifie it ſelfe, and ſtand it out even againſt the verdict of God, if hee be given over to tentation; for, ſo doth <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Anſwer to the Lords queſtion teach: <hi>I doe wel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be angry,</hi> or, <hi>I am greatly angry, even unto death.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will pleaſe him but death, to bee by it rid of thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord doth now apply all that is paſt to his preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and from this diſcontent of <hi>Jonah,</hi> lets him ſee the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of his former murmuring; for, if hee had given way to himſelfe ſo paſſionately to commiſerate ſo ſmal a thing as a gourd, in producing whereof hee had no hand, which was of ſo ſhort continuance, and which needed no pity, and that onely becauſe he received ſome profit and refreſhment by it, why did
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169976:39"/>he ſo much ſtumble that the Lord ſpared <hi>Nineveh,</hi> which was his handy work, and every way conſiderable; there being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in it that eminently called for pity, being neither ſenſible of any thing, nor yet by groſſe actual tranſgreſſions had provoked the Lord to denounce that judgement? So that here the Lord is not approving <hi>Ionah</hi>'s paſſion, but by a reaſon drawn from the leſs to the more (wherein <hi>Ionah</hi> a creature, and the great Lord, a ſtick, and great <hi>Nineveh</hi> are compared,) <hi>Ionah</hi> is convinced of ſelfiſhneſſe in approving himſelf in doing that unjuſtly, which he condemned in God, when done moſt mercifully and rightly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Self-love will eaſily blinde men ſo far as to make them approve themſelves in doing of worſe things then thoſe they condemn in others; for this is the ſcope of this reproof, to ſhew <hi>Jonah,</hi> that he would not allow the Lord on juſt cauſes to be merciful; and yet could allow himſelf in his ſelfiſh paſſion. 2. Much more latitude ought to be allowed to God in his way of working without our quarrelling, then we may take to our ſelves; for, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Thou,</hi> who mayeſt be blinded with fancie and humour, <hi>hadſt pity,</hi> and allowedſt thy ſelf in it, <hi>and ſhould not</hi> I, a wiſe and ſovereign Lord, <hi>ſpare Nineveh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he to whom abſolute ſubmiſſion of ſpirit is due, though I thus reaſon thee out of thy folly? 3. The Lord can eaſily take off the veile of fair pretexts from ſelfiſh men, and let them be ſeen in their owne colours; for, whatever <hi>Ionah</hi> might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as the cauſe of his grief for <hi>Ninevehs</hi> ſparing: the Lord by this demonſtrates, that his bitterneſs flowed indeed from love to himſelf, as might be ſeen in the matter of the Gourd. 4. Men under tentation and in an ill way, are not without much difficulty convinced that they are wrong; therefore the Lord uſeth all theſe meanes that <hi>Jonah</hi> may take with the reproof, when by lively demonſtrations and deeds he ſhould ſee his errour, <hi>Thou hadſt pity upon the Gourd &amp;c. And ſhould not I ſpare</hi> Nineveh? 5. The Lord is ſo conſtant in his good-will, that he will not only ſhew mercy, but wil maintain his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, againſt all who will oppoſe it; for here he pleads for his mercy to <hi>Nineveh</hi> againſt <hi>Jonah, Should not I ſpare</hi> Nineveh? 6. The Lord by his practice teacheth us, to let out our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon objects according as they are of worth in themſelves; therefore albeit nothing can be of worth to him, yet he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <hi>Jonahs pity on the gourd:</hi> a thing of ſo ſmal worth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in one night, and periſhing in another, as far worſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, then his mercy in <hi>ſparing</hi> Nineveh <hi>that great City,</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169976:39"/>therefore the more to be tendered by him. 7. The Lords crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men, may give ground of hope to the ſenſible ſinner, that God delights not in his deſtruction, but upon repentance will be willing to ſpare; for, while he reaſons from <hi>Jonahs</hi> pity on the gourd, <hi>for which he had not laboured, neither made it grow,</hi> he teacheth that he could not but ſpare repenting <hi>Nineveh,</hi> it being his own handy-work. 8. Not only perſons come to maturity, and turning to God, but even their children, yea, and cattel, who cannot ſenſibly acknowledg him, do concur to plead for pity to the penitent at Gods hands: and his mercy will look on their condition and number as a reaſon of ſparing; for, he knoweth what Infants are in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> how innocent they were of groſſe provocations, and that there was much cattel there, and from that pleads, that ſo great a City, wherein there are ſo many Infants, and ſo much cattel ſhould be ſpared. 9. The children of the Lord will at laſt be cleared and ſatisfied with all the Lords diſpenſations, and will ſubmit to Gods way in them, as only right and wiſe, however they repine under their fits of tentation; for, the Lord gets the laſt word in this debate, and therefore it is evident from <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſilence, and not anſwering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that he ſubmitted at laſt; in teſtimony whereof, and of his unfeigned repentance for his miſcarriage, he glorifieth God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtring all theſe paſſages for the edification of the Church: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo is held forth the infallible certainty of holy Scripture, in that the Penmen thereof were ſo little their own in writing of it, as they ſpare not at Gods command, to regiſter their own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he may be glorified.</p>

                     <p>THe word of the LORD that came to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah the Moraſhite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah Kings of Judah, which he ſaw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Samaria and Jeruſalem.</p>

                  <p>THe Inſcription or Title of the Prophecy doth contain a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the meſſenger imployed, from his name and the City where he was born, (conceived to be that City <hi>Marſhah</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah, Ioſh.</hi> 15.44. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.8. and 14.9, 10. which is here threatned, <hi>v.</hi> 15.) as likewiſe his commiſſion from God; the time of his propheſying under ſeveral kings of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and a declaration that his commiſſion extended to both the kingdomes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> and eſpecially to the chiefe Cities thereof. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Men are not to run unſent on publick imployments in Gods houſe, but to waite upon a call and commiſſion; and, having received it, to cleave cloſely to it; for, <hi>the Word of the Lord came to</hi> Micah, and he publiſhed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the Word of the Lord that came to him,</hi> and <hi>which be ſaw, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The meſſages and challenges ſent by the Lords ſervants unto the Church, are to be looked on as ſent from him, whoſe challenge the conſcience cannot flee, as being more then our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169976:41"/>party, and as being moſt certain and infallible: Therefore this doctrine is held out to be <hi>the Word of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Micah ſaw</hi> this; to wit, in viſion, or by prophetick revelation, implying that what he ſaid, was as certain as if it were ſeen accompliſhed. 3. The Lord in his great mercy and long ſuffering, is pleaſed not to with-hold a teſtimony from his backſliding people, but by multiplication, and long continuance of Prophets, is pleaſed to forewarne them of ruine, if ſo be they may turne and prevent it. Therefore is not only backſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> honoured with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but there are many at once in both Kingdomes, and theſe propheſying long in the time of many Kings; for, not onely is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> at the ſame time with <hi>Micah</hi> propheſying in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> but <hi>Hoſea,</hi> if not alſo <hi>Amos</hi> in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as may be gathered from the inſcription of their Prophecies. Frequent ſending of Prophets and meſſengers is either a means of ſtirring up to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as when <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> were ſent out almoſt at one time, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.1. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.2. or a preſage of ſpeedily approaching ruine where their meſſage is not received, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16, 17. 4. The ſervants of God muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to have alwayes ſweet times and fair weather in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their generation; but ought to look for variety of times and conditions to wreſtle with; ſuch was the lot of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he lived <hi>in the dayes of Jotham, Ahaz, &amp;c.</hi> Having to do not only with wicked Kings in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who lived in the ſame time with theſe Kings in <hi>Judah;</hi> and in <hi>Judah</hi> he had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a pious <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to deal with, but a wicked <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and a <hi>Jotham,</hi> in whoſe dayes reformation was not ſo through, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hezekiah</hi> or <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and he did ſee the total ruine of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the affliction of <hi>Judah</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> 5. As the Lord will not ſpare his own people when they provoke him; ſo doth he in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity deal with them according to the degrees of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations: therefore is there a ſad meſſage <hi>concerning Jeruſalem</hi> and they muſt not take it ill to be joyned with <hi>Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To conciliate Authority to the enſuing Doctrine, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſummons all the creatures, and all people to be witneſſes to this proceſſe, againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> and to one ſolemne Court day; wherein the Lord would judg and witneſs againſt his people, and by his judgements ſhould vindicate the ſentence of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants againſt ſin, from all contempt of unbelievers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Word of the Lord ought to be gravely, and with all Authority delivered by his Meſſengers; therefore doth <hi>Micah</hi> by this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn charge to all creatures to appear, declare that his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was a grave purpoſe, not to be ſlighted, and that it was the Lord who hath command of all creatures, and not men only they had to do with. 2. It is uſual for the viſible Church, not only to ſlip through inadvertency, but eſpecially to drown her ſelf in Apoſtaſie; and having once fallen away, to prove ſo void of all ſenſe of Piety, ſo ſelfiſh and ſo obſtinate, as not to be eaſily convinced; and ſo ſtupid in ſin, as not to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of approaching wrath: therefore muſt there be a ſolemn citation of all Nations, as if there were need of a dayes-man to awake them from their ſleep, and <hi>the Lord muſt be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them,</hi> ere they be convinced. 3. God is a witneſſe, whoſe teſtimony may and will convince of ſin, as not only knowing all things perfectly, but when he declares this with power, either inwardly to a conſcience only, or outwardly by corrections alſo, he will convince the moſt obſtinate; <hi>Let the Lord be witneſſe againſt you,</hi> and he will carry his point. 4. When ſin is come to an height in the Church, and they will not take with, or ſtrive to amend it, then the Lord will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, in view of all the world, convince and correct them by his ſtroaks; therefore doth he call <hi>all people, the earth, and all that therein is,</hi> to hear and ſee the Lord witneſſing againſt his Church: which is a bitter caſe when our betrothed Lord is provoked to go out of doors to the ſtreets with his beloveds faults. 5. The juſtice and equity of the Lords dealing with his people, even when he proceeds to ſeverity in correction, is ſo uncontrovertedly clear, as that it may be ſeen and read of all, therefore alſo are the creatures called to appear, as witneſſes of his proceedings, and that affliction is juſtly procured by <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 6. If this paſſage, <hi>from his holy Temple,</hi> be underſtood of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it teacheth, that however men may obſtinately bear out againſt all convictions from men, yet the glorious Majeſty of God, when he lets forth any rayes of it from heaven, (as <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4.) in his works, it will ſo dazle them, as they ſhall not be able
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169976:42"/>to ſtand out: If we underſtand it of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it teacheth, that the Jewes their confiding much in the Temple, ſhould not exempt them, but rather be a part of their ditty; that the mercies of God, manifeſted there, and from thence unto them, ſhould effectually convince them of ſin, and aggravate it, who have not walked anſwerably; and that <hi>Iſraels</hi> renouncing of that Temple and the worſhip of God, there ſhall be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſad challenge, which they will not be able to anſwer. In all theſe reſpects <hi>the Lord God will be witneſſe from his holy Temple.</hi>

                  <p>To ſtir them up the more, and to make them heed the meſſage, he declares in general Gods purpoſe concerning them; that he would manifeſt himſelf in his glory from heaven, and trample under his feet whatever is moſt eminent, and make high and low feel the effects of his Preſence and Juſtice, according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, which when he pleaſeth to let forth, will make mountains to tremble and reſolve into duſt; and vallyes to cleave, as wax melteth before a fire, and as waters run with violence down a ſteep place. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However the Lord do moſt clearly manifeſt his glory in heaven, and Atheiſts and carnal men think he is ſhut up there; yet as he is every where filling heaven and earth; ſo will he, when he pleaſes, manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence on earth, in glorious effects of providence; for ſo doth this ſpeech import, <hi>The Lord cometh forth out of his place;</hi> that however heaven be in a peculiar way his habitation, yet he will from thence appear in glorious majeſty on earth. 2. The glorious manifeſtations of God in the world, ought to be looked upon with reverence, admiration, and humble wondring. So much doth <hi>behold</hi> prefixed to this manifeſtation, import. 3. It is quite beſide the expectation of a back-ſliding Church, that God ſhould appear in ſeverity againſt them; and therefore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169976:42"/>ſuch a diſpenſation ſurprizeth them: ſo much alſo doth this <hi>Behold</hi> teach, that to them who ſtill dream of peace with God, notwithſtanding their wicked way, it ſhould be an unexpected and ſudden thing to ſee him appear in glory to puniſh. 4. The greatneſſe and majeſty of God, ought to be well ſtudied and conſidered upon, by all thoſe who oppoſe him, and reject his will, not to drive them yet further from him, but rather to cruſh their obſtinacy, and induce them to repent; for, Gods Majeſty is here held forth to make them tremble, to be found in a way diſapproved of his Word. 5. Men in their declinings from God, ſeek unto themſelves falſe refuges, whereby they think to ſhelter themſelves againſt Gods vengeance, but are herein deluded; for, <hi>there are high places of the earth;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are ſignified their Idols worſhipped on theſe high places, wherein they truſted, or their ſtrong holds, or high and lofty men, who thought to be exempted from common judgements; or, generally their high and lofty imaginations, all which, or whatſoever elſe they can oppoſe, the Lord is potent to cruſh; <hi>He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.</hi> 6. Greatneſs of oppoſition againſt God, contributes to ſet him out more eminently by cruſhing thereof; for, <hi>He treads on the high places,</hi> that is, not only cruſhes and commands them, but is the more eminently ſeen in ſo doing, in that they are high; their height making them conſpicuous from afar, while he ſtands upon them. 7. The Lord is able to overturne what is greateſt and moſt ſtable in the world, and make all creatures feel his power and indignation in an effectual way; this is held forth in that the <hi>mountains ſhall be molten under him, and thevalleys cleft as wax before the fire, &amp;c.</hi> 8. Sin in the people of God, makes that which otherwiſe might be comfortable, matter of terrour to them; for, whereas the Majeſty and Power of God is comfortable to the Church, in that ſhe hath ſuch a God to cruſh her enemies, and wherein they deal proudly to be above them; yet now, becauſe of ſin, it is the matter of her terror: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be ſo far comfortable, as that all this is done to drive her to his mercy.</p>

When his people provoke him, he can ſend afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond expreſſion, and ſuch ſorrows as no outward ſignes can ſufficiently vent; for, this <hi>bowling, wailing, and going na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> doth import ſo much in the Prophet foreſeeing the ſtorme, and doth foretell, that it ſhall be ſo with the people, when they feele it. 2. It is the duty of faithfull Miniſters, not onely to denounce judgement againſt ſinne and ſinners, but ſo to doe it as may make them moſt ſenſible of their danger before they feele it in reality; therefore doth <hi>Micah waile, and howle, &amp;c.</hi> that they might thereby read the reality and weight of the threatning, and ſtudy to prevent the execution. 3. A moſt effectuall way of making people ſenſible of threatnings, is, when the meſſengers themſelves are affected with them when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them; for, therefore doth <hi>Micah,</hi> who carried this meſſage, <hi>waile and howle.</hi> 4.

                  <p>In giving a reaſon of his ſorrow, he yet further deſcribes the calamity from the univerſality of it, that <hi>Samaria,</hi> as ſhee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately ſick of provocations, without any hope that ever ſhee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169976:45"/>ſhould amend; ſo her ſtroak was incurable; and that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian having deſtroyed them, that fire ſhould burn through all Judah, even to Jeruſalem, the mother-City, and ſeat of juſtice to all the Jewes, of whom he was one, and whom hee loved dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And ſo hee comes to the ſecond branch of the Threatning which is againſt Judah and Jeruſalem; as was likewiſe foretold by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 8.7, 8. and accompliſhed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.13. &amp;c. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a bitter cauſe of complaint, when ſtroaks inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God are irremediable, whereas a ſtroak is eaſie wherein there is hope of deliverance; therefore doth <hi>Micah</hi> waile, <hi>for her wound is incurable.</hi> 2. Albeit the Lord begin his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for ſin where it pleaſed him; yet when hee lifts up his hand, ſuch as are guilty of the ſame ſinnes, may think not to eſcape; for when the wound is begun at Samaria, <hi>it comes unto</hi> Judah, <hi>he is come to the gate of my people, &amp;c.</hi> Jeruſalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo called, becauſe it was the ſeate of juſtice, which uſed to be adminiſtred publickly in the gate. 3. The Lord may ſuſpend his corrections upon his Church for her backſliding, untill a time of reformation, and then inflict them; for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Ahaz</hi> had his own fears from <hi>Rezin</hi> King of Syria, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. yet the correction for the high places of Judah (of which ver. 5.) is by the Aſſyrian, who deſtroyed Samaria, and that in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the Reformer, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. <hi>It is come</hi> (to wit from <hi>Samaria</hi>) <hi>into Judah.</hi> The reaſon of which, is partly, becauſe Reformation being not ſet about ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and cordially, (as it was in the body of Judah in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's</hi> time, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.6, 10.) doth ſo much the more provoke the Lord to puniſh for former Apoſtaſie; partly, the Lord chuſeth a time of Reformation to puniſh in, that a people, being at ſuch a time ſenſible of the ſinne procuring the ſtroak, the affliction may be bleſſed to make them reform the more throughly; and partly, the Lord chuſeth this time, that the ſtroak may be the more moderate, there being ſome ſtanding in the gap, and no totall backſliding; and accordingly we finde Jeruſalem preſerved, though threatned. 4. The affections of the Lords ſervants in a time of diſtreſſe, ought to be ſet on work to ſympathize chiefly with ſuch as are moſt dear to God; therefore ſaith <hi>Micah, He is come to the gate of my people</hi> Not ſo much his, becauſe hee was their countrey-man, (which ought not to ſway with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in publick adminiſtrations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.8, 9. though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be tender even in that reſpect, is commendable) as becauſe they were more upright in Religion then Samaria, and

                  <p>In the next place, the calamity of the people, and cauſe of the Prophets ſorrow, is held forth to be ſo great, that it were to be wiſhed, that their enemies (ſuch as the Philiſtims in Gath) never knew of it, and ſo might not inſult over them in their miſery, to add to their affliction; and therefore in a figurative way (uſuall in Lamentations, and borrowed from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20.) they are injoyned to conceal their affliction from ſuch, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their weeping, leſt they ſhould hear it: <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There are ſtill ſome in the world waiting for matter of joy in the Churches calamities, whoſe gladdeſt day will be to ſee her in trouble; For, ſo much doth this prohibition <hi>to declare it in Gath,</hi> import. 2. Of all enemies, ſuch are among the moſt inveterate, as being neereſt unto the people of God, yet partake not of their mercies, for, ſuch were theſe at Gath, lying hard upon the borders of Judah, from whom eſpecially they would conceale their grief. 3. It is a new grief, and great addition to the afflictions of the godly, that enemies by reaſon of their calamities, take occaſion to reproach them, their God, and Religion. And it would be a deliverance in part, to have their caſe concealed from ſuch, and an eaſe to ſmother their grief, if that could conceal it; for, this charge, <hi>Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all,</hi> doth import the Churches wiſh, that ſuch knew it not, and her eaſe if it were ſo. 4. The Church of God muſt reſolve not onely to have afflictions, but alſo to have them noted and obſerved by enemies, and to lie under all their inſolencies and reproaches becauſe of them, till their triall be perfected; for, while in a figurative way the Prophet thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits, it intimates that it could not be hid, and that the Church had this added to her triall.</p>
                  <p>In the reſt of this Chapter to the laſt verſe, the greatneſſe of this ſtroak, and the cauſe of the Prophets ſorrow, is yet further ſet forth, in a particular and pathetick enumeration of ſuch places (eſpecially as would appear in Judah) as ſhould feele the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Warr, and what their calamity ſhould be; and albeit
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169976:46"/>we find no mention elſewhere of divers places named here, eſpecially theſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. yet we are to conceive, that they are either proper names of places (though unknowne to us) choſen out from among other places, in regard the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their names, doth illuſtrate their condition by the War: or, that they are appellative and borrowed names given to ſome places from their qualities, properties or condition, to illuſtrate, their calamity in the enſuing tempeſt, as may be ſeen in the particulars. And ſo here by <hi>Aphrah</hi> ſignifying <hi>duſt,</hi> we are to underſtand either that City in <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Joſh. 18.23. where the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was to come (and which was far from the Philiſtines hearing,) or, generally, a place brought to the duſt, and made duſty by affliction, who therefore are to roll themſelves in the duſt, in token of great ſorrow for their duſty and afflicted condition; ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the children of God by their behaviour in trouble, are to give no occaſion of reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto enemies; ſo are they before the Lord to evidence, that they are ſenſible of his hand; for, as they are <hi>not to weep at all</hi> in <hi>Gath,</hi> or where the Philiſtines may hear it, ſo are they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>in the houſe of Aphrah</hi> amongſt themſelves, to expreſſe their ſorrow. 2. As great afflictions will be very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and bitter, making men without any regard to themſelves, wallow in duſt and aſhes; ſo the ſweet uſe of trouble is, when men ſtoop to their condition, and to what it calls unto, while <hi>Aphrah</hi> made duſty by affliction deſcends to the duſt; <hi>in the houſe of</hi> Aphrah <hi>roll, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Our kindly bed in trouble, is duſt, as being duſt by our Original, and the end of affliction being to let us know we are ſuch, <hi>In the houſe of Aphrah</hi> (or, <hi>of duſt</hi>) <hi>roll thy ſelf in the duſt.</hi>

Humane helps and greateſt probabilities, will prove but vain in a day of vengeance; for, a place of repair ſuch (as <hi>Zaanan</hi>) will not be able to help, no not a place neer unto them; whereas either their number, or the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the place afflicted, might ſeem to promiſe otherwiſe. 2. It is an uſual thing in a day of calamity to ſee men ſelfiſh and taken up with their own grievances, without regarding others, and to ſee the Lord give every man and place ſo much to do as ſhall give him no leaſure to look about him: <hi>Zaanan came not forth in the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Beth-ezel, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ier.</hi> 47.3. 3.

However it be both lawful and neceſſary for a people to beſtir themſelves for their own defence in danger; yet ſuch is the fierceneſs of Gods anger purſuing forſin, as all oppoſition made to the inſtruments thereof, doth but tend to the oppoſers greater diſadvantage, while as the enemies loſſe of time, means or men, is made up by their ſpoil and further ruine; for ſo much doth the other interpretation of that paſſage (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees alſo with the principal ſcope) import.</p>

                  <p>This verſe contains another evidence that there ſhall bee no ſtanding againſt that calamity, and therefore comes in, as a farther clearing of that in the end of the former verſe, as appears by the Particle, <hi>for.</hi> The ſignification of <hi>Maroth</hi> (which is <hi>bitterneſs</hi>) and of the Original word rendred, <hi>waited,</hi> which ſignifieth alſo to be grieved, and of the word rendred <hi>But,</hi> which ſignifies chiefly <hi>Becauſe;</hi> leads to this interpretation of the verſe; That thoſe whoſe condition is made bitter by affliction, ſhould earneſtly expect for ſome good; but in vain, they ſhould yet be more grieved for want of it, and for diſappointment of theſe expectations, and that becauſe the trouble ſhould overſpread, and reach to the gates of the royal City where the Temple was. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord ariſeth to plead againſt ſinners, he can put them in a very diſconſolate condition, and make all their pleaſures end in bitterneſs: for, in this calamity there is, <hi>The inhabitant of Maroth,</hi> or <hi>of Bitterneſſes,</hi> even many of them; See <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.20. 2 Howſoever afflicted people do uſually much look out for ſome iſſue, yet grief may be oft-times but growing, when ſuch as have felt ſome bitterneſſe, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an end of it; for, <hi>The inhabitant of Maroth was grieved</hi> (or <hi>ſick with grief) for good,</hi> which they wanted, though <hi>they waited carefully</hi> for better, as the word alſo ſignifies. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.19 3. Sometime the only comfort left a people in trouble may be this, that a greater trouble is coming to ſhoulder out, and make them forget a leſſer: <hi>Evil coming unto Jeruſalem,</hi> to make them forget particular grievances; and <hi>from the Lord,</hi> to make them digeſt the Aſſyrians fury. 4. Afflictions ſent from God upon the Church, are to be obſerved and laid to heart, as not only ſad in themſelves, but as Preſages of great anger to come on the reſt of the world beſide; for, they were grieved <hi>for good, becauſe evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jeruſalem;</hi> that added to their grief, and was an evidence of their own hopeleſſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

When mens ſpirits are ſo taken up with wickedneſſe, that they delight themſelves with acting it in their owne imaginations: <hi>Wo to them that work evil on their beds:</hi> that is, are ſo tranſported, that their ſpirits and fancy imagine themſelves, as acting thoſe wickedneſſes, which they cannot for preſent get really acted, and thus think to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelves. 4. When mens hearts are ſo farre engaged in their premeditate wickedneſſe, that without taking leiſure betwixt their deliberation and practiſe, to bethink themſelves what they are doing, they run eagerly about the execution of their purpoſes, which is the wofull fruits of giving ſin too much roome in the heart, that being Maſter there, it violently and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually commands our practiſe: for, <hi>Wo unto them,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deviſed iniquity, <hi>when the morning is light, they practiſe it.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. 5.

It is an high aggravation of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the oppreſſor is not ſtraitned with neceſſity and want, driving him on ſuch courſes; but his covetous diſpoſition is the only cauſe of all his miſcarriage; for, here the quarrel is, that becauſe they <hi>covet,</hi> therefore, <hi>they take by violence.</hi> 3 Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe given way unto, and entertained in mens hearts, will drive them beyond all bounds and moderation; for, <hi>They covet fields and houſes:</hi> every thing they get, ſerves but as a bait to draw them on further; ſo dangerous is it once to tranſgreſs the bounds of contentment preſcribed by God. 4.

The Lord will recompence all his delayes in executing vengeance for ſin, with the ſeverity of it when it comes; therefore, in oppoſition to their <hi>deviſing iniquity, verſe</hi> 1. (that they might execute it well, as they thought) <hi>the Lord deviſeth an evil,</hi> ſaith he, that is, it ſhall be as ſore and ſharp an evil, as if it had been moſt ſeriouſly deviſed, and all the time of delay had been imployed for that effect. 4. Sin publickly acted without controlment, will bring on judgments againſt a whole people; <hi>Therefore,</hi> (becauſe oppreſſion was committed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly) <hi>againſt this family do I deviſe an evil;</hi> that is, againſt this whole Nation, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1, 2. even the notorious ſins of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, (much more of publick Miniſters of Juſtice) not being puniſhed: or ſuch ſins becoming univerſal, cannot but bring judgments upon a whole Land. 5. However Oppreſſors may think to ſhift the Lords viſitations, yet when they come they ſhall ſeize upon them, and their violence ſhall be met with afflictions, which they cannot ſhake off; for, it is <hi>an evil from which ye ſhall not remove your necks.</hi> 6. Albeit men alſo dream, that if they cannot exempt themſelves from judgments, yet they will courageouſly and undauntedly bear out under them; yet the Lord by his rods will make the moſt haughty to ſtoop, for, <hi>Neither ſhall ye go haughtily.</hi> 7.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169976:52"/>expoſtulation with this people, now ſo far degenerated, as thus to contemn and oppoſe his Meſſengers; as if they might limit his Spirit to ſpeak only what pleaſed them: or, as if his Spirit were ſtraitned to do them good, and preach comforts, if they were fit for them; that he muſt only threaten, and poſeth them, if their wayes and doings were approved of God, and ſuch as called for comfortable doctrine; and whether they could alledge that threatnings and judgments were his uſual way of dealing with his people in which he delighted, if he were not provoked thereunto by their ſin, and appeales to themſelves if his words did not both ſpeak and perform good things, and would prove ſo to them if they were holy; and conſequently it was not he nor his Prophets, but themſelves that were to blame, that the Word ſpake hard things unto them, and that accordingly they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a deplorable caſe, and ſadly to be lamented, when men ſtand in oppoſition to the Word of God, and the Carriers thereof: ſo much doth this expoſtulation, and theſe preſſing interrogatories imply. 2. Men may both think and do many things with great boldneſſe, which yet if they ſhould ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think upon, they would be forced to condemn and finde a witneſs againſt in their own boſomes: for, theſe queſtions put to their conſciences, imply, that God had a witneſs for him there, and they durſt not ſay nor do as they did, if their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were put to it as in his ſight. 3. Many have, and ſtudy to keep up a name which they are ill worthy of, and no way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it. <hi>O thou that are named the houſe of Jacob,</hi> ſaith he, but no way like that which <hi>Jacob</hi> was, and ſhould be: See, <hi>John</hi> 8.40. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3. 4. God can diſcover betwixt ſhewes and ſubſtance, and will ſee a fault in ſuch as glory in faire titles, for he calls them as they are: <hi>Thou art named the houſe of Jacob,</hi> and haſt but a name. 5. It is an evidence that a viſible Church is degenerated whatever ſhew they have, when they turn oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Word of the Lord in the mouth of his ſervants, and of his ſervants for their meſſage cauſe, it being the true glory of the Church to have meſſengers carrying Gods mind unto them, and to entertain the meſſage and meſſengers as becometh; for, it is upon this account they get this title, <hi>Thou art named, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Such as oppoſe and fight againſt the Word of God and his Meſſengers, do in effect fight againſt the Spirit of the Lord, whoſe Word it is; for, theſe oppoſers are challenged, as <hi>ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> 7. It is an high preſumption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169976:53"/>done to the Spirit, to think to impriſon and deny him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the mouth of his ſervants to ſpeak any thing but what men pleaſe: for, <hi>Is the ſpirit of the Lird ſtraitned?</hi> imports, that it was not ſeemly they ſhould limit him in giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his ſervants. 8. The Lord hath a ſtore-houſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to bring forth comforts, and of power to produce mercies, if his people were fit for them; for, <hi>Is the ſpirit of the Lord ſtraitn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> imports alſo, that it was not for want of fulneſſe in his Spirit, to publiſh or performe good things, that the Prophets got only commiſſion to threaten; ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.2. 9. When the Lord ſends forth ſad threatnings in the mouths of his ſervants, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a people ſeriouſly to examine their wayes, to ſee them diſapproved of God, and deſerving ſuch entertainment: therefore he leads them from quarrelling with the Spirit of God or his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſeriouſly to conſider, <hi>Are theſe his doings?</hi> that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own wayes are agreeable to the law, or ſuch as the Spirit of God works in his people. 10. The Lords ordinary way of dealing with his people, in which hee delights, is mercie; for, <hi>Are theſe his doings?</hi> imports alſo, that however hee did now threaten and deal harſhly with them, yet they might be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly convinced that it was not his uſuall way ſo to doe, nor a courſe in which he took pleaſure, if their caſe did not call for it. See <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. 11. That which God looks to and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in his people, is not ſo much their profeſſion &amp; ſpeaking, as their walking and carriage, and that they ſtudy a conſtant courſe of uprightneſſe and ſincerity, although they cannot attain to perfection; for, it is required <hi>that they walk uprightly.</hi> 12. As the upright walker will need the Word much for direction and encouragement; ſo to ſuch the Word ſpeaks onely good, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may reade and apply it wrong ſometimes, by reaſon of their diſtempers and fears, and may miſtake when the Word ſpeaks againſt their corruptions, which is without prejudice to their ſincerity, and when the Word ſpeaks hard things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their further good is promoted in the end: for, <hi>do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> 13. The Words ſaying of good, is indeed a doing of good, not only becauſe comfortable meſſages do encourage, ſtrengthen and revive the heart; but alſo in regard of the certaine performance of what the Word ſaith: when it is ſaid, it may be counted done; <hi>My words doe good.</hi> 14. The goodneſſe of God to his people may deeply convince and humble them, who by ſin provoke him to doe otherwiſe;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169976:53"/>Therefore is all this ſet forth to be in God, that their ſin may be ſeen great which cauſeth ſuch ſtrange dealing.</p>

Contempt of, and oppoſition unto Gods Word and Meſſengers, turnes men barbarous and inhumane, without all civility; and men following ſuch courſes cannot expect that the Word ſhould ſpeak peace to them; for, this is a fruit of their oppoſing the Prophets, that they were given over to ſuch cruelty; and is the cauſe why hard things were propheſied. 2. The degenerating of men from former good wayes, and the preſent evils of the time, are much to be obſerved, and hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the ſervants of God; for, this is the ſubject of his accuſation, that <hi>even of late,</hi> or <hi>yeſterday,</hi> they were thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated. 3. As declining profeſſours are ordinarily plagued with ſingular profanity, ſo profeſſion and priviledges will ſerve to aggravate the guilt thereof; therefore, howſoever they were onely <hi>in name the houſe of Jacob, ver</hi> 7. yet in the challenge the Lord gives them their titles, <hi>my people is riſen up, &amp;c.</hi> that ſince they would be accounted ſo, hee would make uſe of it to their diſadvantage who would not walke anſwerable to what they pretended to. 4.

God, the preſerver of men, hath a ſpecial regard to the weaker ſexe and tenderer years of perſons; and will aggravate injuries done to them from ſuch conſiderations; as here, <hi>ye have caſt out women, and taken away glory from their children,</hi> or, little <hi>ones.</hi> 4.

There is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial glory allowed by God unto his Church, whereby ſhe may be ſeparated from all people, which the Lord wil main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her in, againſt all who would deprive her thereof; this is ſignified by that external glory, and the priviledges confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (called, <hi>my glory,</hi> becauſe allowed of him) which now he challenges oppreſſors for depriving their children of while they were put in a condition not beſeeming the free people of

It may alſo be interpreted, that by making children bondmen, they aimed to deprive them of their glory perpetually; and ſo however children might be relieved from bondage, yet they are reckoned with according to their aim, and the nature of their work: and it teacheth, whatever the Lord may do in interpoſing to moderate the afflictions unjuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by men; yet inſtruments muſt anſwer to God for all that the nature of their work tended to, and for all they intended in it.</p>

It is no new thing to ſee men pretending to the Spirit of God, and revelations and light from him, who are but deceivers, if not deceived alſo, and ſent for a plague to a ſinful people; for, there are, who <hi>walk in the Spirit</hi> (that is, pretend to inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169976:55"/>as Prophets) and yet all this is but falſhood, and their doctrine a lie. 3.

Such as pretend to any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in Gods houſe or ſervice, without his call or approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ordinarily branded with badges of his diſpleaſure; for, theſe <hi>walking in the Spirit,</hi> or pretending to revelation, are plagued either with deluſion or impudency, (as ſuch ordinarily are, who abuſe light moſt,) in that they dare <hi>propheſie of wine, and ſtrong drink</hi> to a rebellious people. 6. Albeit the Lord may for a time forbear groſſe ſinners; yea, and plague them with proſperity alſo, yet it is falſe doctrine to preach peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity to a profane people, ſo as if God approved of them when he gives them proſperity, or as if any proſperity they got were not ripening them for ſorer judgements: for, as theſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>lyed,</hi> in reſpect they wanted a revelation and commiſſion to deliver ſuch a Doctrine, when on the contrary God was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that people: ſo it is ſtill a lye in theſe termes, <hi>to propheſie of wine and ſtrong drink</hi> to ſuch a people. 7. As it is a woful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when all that the viſible Church is ſet upon, is pleaſure and proſperity, and all they have to do with Prophets, is to make them glad with hopes thereof: (he is their choice, not who ſpeaks to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Lord in the cloſe of the Chapter ſweetens the former threatnings with promiſes of reſtitution of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> under Chriſt; wherein are contained their recollection and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Chriſt as their ſhepherd ſhall gather them in one, ſhall feed, ſecure and multiply them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. that all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhal be taken out of their way, that might hinder their progreſſe, and that their march ſhall be ſtately, and their conduct ſafe; Chriſt their King who is the Lord, going before them as their general on the head of them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. In the throng of greateſt diſpleaſure, the truly godly are allowed comfort, that they be not cruſhed with threatnings, whereof they are moſt apprehenſive by reaſon of their tenderneſſe; for, in the midſt of theſe threatnings, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> get a promiſe; See, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.4, 5. 2. The children of God ought to ſtudy much the certainty of Promiſes, that they may without heſitation rely upon them; <hi>I will ſurely aſſemble, I will ſurely gather,</hi> ſaith he, or <hi>in aſſembling aſſemble,</hi> which imports his perſiſting in that work till he perfect it. 3. Spiritual reſtauration by Chriſt, is ample matter of comfort to all believers in times of publick calamities: for that is the ſubſtance of this promiſe held forth for their comfort: it was their comfort under the Law to foreſee it, and ought to be ours for to enjoy it; See <hi>John</hi> 8.56. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.23, 24. 4. As no viciſſitude of diſpenſations hath buried in oblivion that Covenant made with <hi>Jacob</hi> and his ſeed, ſo the Catholick Church of Believers of all Nations have right to the ſpiritual promiſes made to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his ſeed: for theſe to whom the promiſes are made are called <hi>Jacob and Iſrael,</hi> to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169976:56"/>ſhew unto the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he would aſſemble them, being mindful of his Covenant; and to confirm all his Elect, that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt they are made his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and heirs to <hi>Iſraels</hi> promiſes. 5. Chriſt the great ſhepherd, will want none of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones, howſoever ſcattered, diſperſed, and far from him, but will have them all gathered and brought in to the fold of his Church; <hi>I wil ſurely aſſemble Jacob all of thee; I will ſurely gather the remnant of Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Lord to ſcattered <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to his ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Elect, through the world; See <hi>John</hi> 10.16. 6. Chriſt, having gathered his people as in one flock, will do the duty of a faithful ſhepherd, in feeding and ſecuring of them from dangers: <hi>I will put them together as the ſheep of Bozrah,</hi> (a place in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> or <hi>Moab,</hi> where there were many flocks and good paſture, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.43, 44. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.24. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.4.) <hi>as the flock in the midſt of their fold.</hi> 7. The Lord, who of remnants can make multitudes, will in his own time bleſſe his Church with increaſe and multiplication of Converts, and hereby will make up the loſs of their ſcatterings and ſufferings: <hi>The remnant ſhal make a noiſe by reaſon of the multitude of men;</hi> See, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.20, 21. 8. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there may be many difficulties in the wayes of God, which his people are to follow; yet a people waiting upon him ſhall find impediments removed to their hand; and that they have nothing to do, but go on till they dip their feet in <hi>Jordans</hi> brink, and he will make it dry; for, <hi>the breaker is come up before them; they have broken up and have paſſed through the gate, and are gone out by it.</hi> The ſpeech alludes to the cuſtome of armies who uſually ſend ſome before to prepare the way, and break through ſtait paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that the army may march without trouble, Paſſes being opened in all places; See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.14. and 62.10. 9. Chriſts Church doth not want a King to go out and in before her, to protect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and guide her in her way, and as a General to fight her bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels; for, <hi>Their King ſhal paſs before them, and the Lord in the head of them,</hi> 10. There is none to be acknowledged as having kingly power in or over the Church, as ſhe is a Church, but he who it the Lord JEHOVAH, for, <hi>their King paſſing before them, is JEHOVAH in the head of them:</hi> that is, their General in the forefront of them, as the word is tranſlated, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.27.

                  <p>THe Prophet having hitherto faithfully diſcovered the ſins of the body of this people, and denounced Gods judgments becauſe of ſin; he comes more particularly to tax the Rulers both in Church and State; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Judah,</hi> and to threaten them for their ſins; and this he doth, 1. Severally, in relation to their own particular puniſhments; The Princes, for that they ought to know right and wrong, and walk accordingly, and yet were moſt perverſe and inhumane in oppreſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. are threatned, that in their ſtrait they ſhall not be owned of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.

                  <p>HEre he challengeth the Rulers in peace and War, for affected ignorance of the Law of God, and layeth a ground for aggrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their wickedneſs, in that it concerned them to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Will of God in the matter of Juſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity then others, and ſo ought to be exemplary in their knowledg
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169976:57"/>and obedience, (knowledge including conſequent affection and practice) whereas they in their practiſe proved themſelves ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or deſpiſers of the Law. Wee need not curiouſly enqure, whether by <hi>Jacob</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> be underſtood, as by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ten tribes; ſeeing the latter part at leaſt of the threatnings in this Chapter, is eſpecially directed againſt <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Ier.</hi> 26.18. but by theſe names we are generally to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that people which were come of <hi>Iudah</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Iſrael. Doct.</hi> 1. When a land in general is culpable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, rulers in Church and State have their owne eminent guilt in it: This is imported in the Prophets ſcope, while as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reproved the whole body of the people, he now comes to challenge the rulers in an eſpecial manner: <hi>Hear O heads of Iacob.</hi> 2. Faithful Miniſters ought not only to inveigh againſt ſinne in general, or of the commonalty only, but in particular ought to reprehend the ſins of every ranke, even of Rulers; for, ſo doth <hi>Micah</hi>'s practice teach. 3. Men in greateſt eminency are bound to heare God ſpeaking by his meſſengers, and to receive what meſſages are ſent unto them, as being under the law as well as others; <hi>Heare O beads of Iacob, and ye Princes of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> 4. As Rulers eſpecially are unwilling to be brought to an account for their wayes by the Miniſtry of the Word, ſo Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are bound to omit no point of diſcretion, and tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, which may conſiſt with their fidelity and zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and which may be inſtrumental to make the word take, and not to be ſtumbled at; for ſo doth <hi>Micab</hi>'s way of intreaty teach; <hi>Hear, I pray you,</hi> which imports both the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers averſeneſſe to heare, and his tender condeſcendence that they may heare. 5. Whatever may be the ſucceſs of a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the diſcharge of his duty, yet his faithfulneſſe and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will be matter of peace to him, when the conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth upon it; as here <hi>Micah</hi> gives a comfortable account of his pains; <hi>I ſaid, Hear &amp;c.</hi> 6. Beſide the general obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lying upon all men, (eſpecially within the viſible Church,) to know and obey the will of God, it is eſpecially incumbent to rulers and great ones among the Lords people ſo to do; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reaſon of their education, means, encouragements, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, offices, &amp;c. enabled with advantages, and bound to know more then others, and to put their knowledge in practice, that they may be examples to others: <hi>O heads of Jacob, and ye prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the houſe of Iſrael, is it not for you to know judgment?</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:169976:58"/>7. It is a good evidence that a man is one who delights to know and obey the revealed Will of God in all things, when hee is carefull in the matter of his particular ſtation to walk by that rule; therefore he puts them to tryal in the matter of <hi>knowing judgement,</hi> or juſtice and equity, which belonged to them in their particular ſtation, as being Judges to the people. 8. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men may oppoſe to the challenges of Miniſters in the matter of affected ignorance, or wilful neglect of knowne duties; yet theſe excuſes will not ſatisfie their owne conſciences, when they are ſeriouſly put to it; therefore the Prophet poſeth them with a queſtion which they could not deny; <hi>Is it not for you to know judgement?</hi>

                  <p>In oppoſition to what they ought to be, hee ſets forth their contrary diſpoſition and practiſe, that they were abhorrers of what was good, and lovers of ill; and they did ſo cruelly oppreſſe and undo the Lords people, by taking away the very means of their ſubſiſtence and livelihood, as if they had flayed their skin from off them, eaten their fleſh, and broken their bones to boyle them for meat, as Butchers and Cookes doe, with beaſts for mans food. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord doth not reckon that men know ought, when the truth being knowne is not affected, nor any endeavours uſed to put it in practiſe; for ſo doth he cleare here their <hi>not knowing of judgement,</hi> in that they <hi>hated the good,</hi> and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 2. The Lord reſpects chiefly the diſpoſition and affection of mens hearts towards good or ill, it being a deſperate condition, when not onely practiſe is out of courſe; but affection alſo is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from God, and inclined to evil; <hi>Who hate the good, and love the evil.</hi> 3. Whatever oppreſſors may pretend to be the cauſe of their cruelty toward their inferiours, as if they ſtood in need, and behooved to live of their owne, &amp;c. yet the Lord
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169976:58"/>ſeeth it to flow from their perverſe and corrupt affections: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſaith he of oppreſſors, <hi>Ye hate the good, and love the evil.</hi> 4. Greateſt perverſity is uſually found in ſuch, as ought, and may, and will not, or neglect to make uſe of ſuch meanes, as might promote piety and juſtice; for, all this perveſitie is in the heads of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who had meanes and occaſion to ſet them on to do otherwiſe; <hi>Ye are they,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who hate the good, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Oppreſſion is in Gods account inhumane butchery, and murther, in a degree far above ſimple ſlaughter, while the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed pine for want, and the oppreſſours (as barbarians or wilde beaſts) eate that which is the poores very life and fleſh; ſo much doth this deſcription of oppreſſion teach us; <hi>Who pluck off their skins from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones, who alſo eate the fleſh of my people, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Albeit Magiſtrates and great men thinke themſelves to be above all law, yet they have no power to oppreſſe a people, (eſpecially if they be Gods people,) and deale with them as they will, but muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their carriage toward them; and howſoever the oppreſſed or others dare not challenge them for their injurious dealing, yet there is a God who will lay it to their charge; for, here they are challenged by God for their oppreſſing his people.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Followeth their particular ſentence and judgement by way of retaliation, that as they oppreſſing the poore, had a deafe eare to their cryes: ſo they would meet with judgement without mercy or compaſſion, and ſhould not be owned of God, though (out of feeeling of their trouble) they ſeeke unto him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The greateſt of men, and they who moſt wickedly forget God, ſhall at one time or other be ſenſibly in Gods reverence, and their errand come in his way; for, ſo doth this threatning import, that they ſhall be put to ſeek God, whom otherwiſe they miſregarded; <hi>Then ſhall they cry.</hi> 2.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169976:59"/>threatned, or their owne particular corrections for their ſin, are lying on) <hi>ſhall they cry.</hi> 3. It is righteous with God not to owne this crying of the wicked in their trouble, becauſe of their former wickedneſſe and preſent unſoundneſſe, and particularly, that he may recompence them, for not hearkening to the cry of the poore, oppreſſed by them: <hi>They ſhal cry unto the LORD, but he will not heare them.</hi> 4. It is extreame miſery to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted totally of God in trouble, and to want his favour and ſenſe of reconciliation, which might ſupport them in any extro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; for, it is here the extremity of miſery, that in their trouble, <hi>he will even hide his face from them as that time.</hi> 5. God, by not owning of a man in trouble, would have wickedneſſe ſeen and lamented as the cauſe of it, (however he ſeem alſo to do this ſometime that he may try the faith of his children;) for, ſo doth this reaſon import: <hi>As they have behaved themſelves ill in their doings.</hi>

As it is a great ſin againſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169976:59"/>God, to ſeduce and miſlead a people, wherein he hath intereſt; ſo the negligence and treachery of Paſtours doth indeare the Lords people ſo much the more unto him, and call for his eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care; for ſo it is imported in this epithete: <hi>They make my people erre;</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.23. 4. It is a great cruelty and murther to proclaime peace to a ſinfull and impenitent people; for, <hi>They bite with their teeth, and cry peace;</hi> their very crying of peace is cruel biting and devouring of ſoules, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.25. 5. It is a mercenary and hireling diſpoſition in Paſtours, to ſeek themſelves or their commodity, as their chiefe and onely ſcope in their calling: for, ſo much alſo doth this challenge teach: <hi>They bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace;</hi> that is, they flatter the people, that ſo they may get occaſion to eat them up, and live upon them. See <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 13.18, 19. or, they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their owne advantage, ſeeking the things of the people and not themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. 6. It is alſo unbeſeeming the faithfull Meſſengers of God, to accommodate the diſcharge of their Miniſtry, ſo as may beſt promote their owne ends, and to threaten, diſcountenance, bleſſe or curſe, according as they get or want their aimed at gaine: ſuch is the practiſe of falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, while they have to bite with their teeth, they cry, <hi>Peace; and he that puts not into their mouths,</hi> (or, <hi>he that giveth not according to their mouthes;</hi> that is, as much as they deſire or ſeek) <hi>they even prepare war againſt him,</hi> and turne his mortal enemy in their doctrine. 7. Men who are covetous, and given to filthy lucre, can hardly be faithfull in a Miniſterial calling, to divide the Word aright, as the example of theſe falſe Prophets teacheth, who look not to the mind of God in diſcharge of their office, but to what might beſt ſuite with their ends, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did frame their doctrine.</p>

A mans clear teſtimony in his conſcience of his calling, fidelity and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from God to diſcharge his calling, will prove comfortable, when the Lord is about to reckon with ſuch as run without his calling; for ſo doth <hi>Micah</hi> upon the back of the threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt falſe teachers comfort himſelfe: <hi>But truly</hi> (there is the certainty of his teſtimony) <hi>I am full of power, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Albeit <hi>Micah</hi> had ſome qualifications extraordinary, yet from this we may gather ſeveral characters of a faithful Miniſter, every one whereof is a leſſon, teaching Miniſters what to ſeeke after: As, 1. However the Lord may bleſſe the meane gifts of ſuch as are honeſt, yet neither are Miniſters to be empty veſſels, nor ſwelled with oſtentation, but a large meaſure of real furniture is to be ſought after; <hi>I am full,</hi> ſaith he. 2. Their endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be not only ſuch as are acquired by the uſe of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means and helps of literature, much leſſe ought their owne ſpirits or humours to bear ſway here; but they ſhould ſeek the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord to ſanctifie their ſpirits and abilities, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them in their dependence on him; for, ſaith he, <hi>I am full by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> which he had extraordinarily as a Prophet, and Miniſters ought to have in an ordinary way: They ought, I ſay, to have not only the Spirit of their calling, but the Spirit of ſanctification alſo, as their duty, and for their own ſoules good: though otherwiſe a man may be a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and may be an inſtrument of true good to others, who yet is not regenerate himſelf. 3. As Miniſters need not only furniture of matter, but ſuch life and zeale in publiſhing the Word, as becomes the Oracles of God; ſo where the Spirit of the Lord is the furniſher, there will be efficacie, life and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169976:61"/>zeale accompanying the doctrine; for, <hi>I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> ſaith he. 4. A faithfull Miniſter ought alſo to be endowed, not onely with ſufficient knowledge to ſpeake according to the Word, and not falſifie the minde of God through ignorance, and with prudence to ſpeak it ſeaſonably; but with fidelity and ſtreigtneſſe in telling the minde of God according to equity and truth, without partiality or regard to one or other; for, ſo much doth the word <hi>judgement</hi> import. 5. Miniſters alſo ſtand in need of fortitude and courage, to ſpeake out boldly what is the minde of God, and conſtantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it, without feare of any, or being blown over with the winde of flattery, and this a faithfull Miniſter muſt and ought to expect from God onely: <hi>I am ful of might by the Spirit of the LORD.</hi> 6. A faithfull Miniſter lookes on all his endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as not given to be layd up and contract reſt beſide him, or for himſelfe onely; but that hee ought to improve them for God and his people, in his place and ſtation: <hi>I am full,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to declare unto Iacob, &amp;c.</hi> and empty out that goodneſſe for their good and behoofe. 7. It is an evidence of a faithfull and able Miniſter to be much in oppoſition to ſin, and freely to charge it home, and <hi>declare tranſgreſſion and ſin</hi> to the ſinner: and not be deceived or blinded with fair titles or ſhews, but to diſcern and reprove ſin even in <hi>Iudah and Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>In the ſecond part of the Chapter, <hi>Micah</hi> gives a proofe of what he hath ſaid of his owne fidelity in ſpeaking to all ſorts of rulers, Civil and Eccleſiaſtick, Ordinary and Extraordinary,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169976:61"/>conjunctly; ſeetting before them their ſinne; and how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <hi>Zions</hi> ruine: he accuſeth the Rulers in State that they who ought to have beene patrons of Juſtice, did abhorre and pervert it, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. that in ſtead of adorning the holy city with juſtice and judgement, their care was ſet upon ſtately buildings, and they gathered means for that end by cruel oppreſſion. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And generally he accuſeth all of them, that juſtice was perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through briberie and covetuouſneſſe, and that their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were mercenary, and made their calling of ordinary teaching and extraordinary divining, ſubſervient to their gain: and yet all of them were carnally confident and preſumptuous of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and preſence among them, and of exemptions from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Perſons in eminency, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtomed to ſinne, are uſually deafe to what the Lord ſaith, and therefore muſt be often called to <hi>heare,</hi> as here they are after that former call, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. 2. The meſſengers of the Lord muſt not give over, when their meſſage is not received, but muſt cry till either they get audience, or have delivered their ſoules; for <hi>Micah</hi> repeats, <hi>Heare I pray you.</hi> 3. It is the duty of faithful Miniſters in reproving the faults of Rulers, to give evidence they doe not condemne their Authority, when they reprove their faults; and not to be wanting in any reſpective carriage which is due unto them; therefore doth <hi>Micah</hi> give them their titles, and againe intreat; <hi>Heare I pray you, yee heads of the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and Princes of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael. Where the Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> to whom this was ſpoken, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.18. are called Rulers in Jacob and Iſrael, not only becauſe the houſe of <hi>David</hi> had ſtill a right to governe all <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a title ſeemeth to be given to <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gr. becauſe there was no more left of all <hi>Jacobs</hi> race after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the ten tribes (which was in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s dayes) but only <hi>Judah</hi> to governe; but becauſe they were Rulers of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that came of the ſtock of <hi>Jacob,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 4. The Lords quarrel againſt men is not ſo much for ſinnes of ignorance and infirmity, as for ſuch as flowe from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diſpoſition, going wrong, becauſe they love to doe ſo, and do hate what is right; therefore are they againe challenged; that they <hi>abhorre judgment, and ſo pervert all equity.</hi> 5. The Lord will admit of no faire precences to palliate any ſinful deed; for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169976:62"/>it is no excuſe that they build <hi>Zion,</hi> if it be done by blood and iniquity, or with goods taken by bloody oppreſſion from the poor; but on the contrary, as it is incident to all pretences, that they prove ſnow-water, and defile that the more which they endeavour to cleanſe: ſo it is the matter of a ſadder quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that they ſhould build the holy City by ſuch meanes; <hi>They build up Zion with blood, and Jeruſalem with iniquity.</hi> 6. Thoſe are unſurely built houſes and eſtates, at the way of raiſing whereof, and gathering means for that end God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: for, it is a quarrel againſt them, and the houſe which they <hi>build with blood and iniquity.</hi> See <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.12. 7. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord allow lawful maintenance to ſuch as are publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in Church and State, yet to receive hire or gifts ſo as to judge partially, becauſe of the gifts received, is groſſe iniquity; for, it is a quarrel here: <hi>The heads thereof judg for reward, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. 8. When bribes are received by men in office, either in Church or State, it is an evidence they will not do their duty faithfully and in ſingleneſſe; for, <hi>judging for reward, teaching for hire, and divining for money,</hi> is all one with falſe judgment, and erroneous teaching, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination; for, true is he who ſaid, <hi>A gift blindeth the wiſe, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 23.8. 9. Preſumption will feed up men with delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under very groſſe ſins, and when a ſtroak is near; for, <hi>Yet will they lean on the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 10. External priviledges of the Church, and external reformation of Worſhip, are ordinarily turned by ſecure ſinners into a ſnare or plague to themſelves, making them dream of Gods favour, and of peace, when wrath is upon them, and trouble at hand. Such a ſnare was Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his Temple, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s reformation to theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane rulers, <hi>Is not the Lord among us? &amp;c.</hi> 11. External pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges will not exempt prophane ſinners from deſerved judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor will external reformation hold it off, but rather ripen the faſter for it; for it was their preſumption even under refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to ſay, <hi>Is not the Lord among us? no evil can come upon us;</hi> ſo long as they had not repented indeed, as it is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.18, 19. 12. God will approve of no faith but ſuch as is fruitful, and ſtirs up men to purifie and cleanſe their heart and way; for, they are here challenged, that when they have done all the former iniquities, and are going on in them, <hi>Yet they wil lean upon the Lord,</hi> or pretend to true faith, whereby a man caſts himſelf and all his burdens on God; <hi>and ſay, Is not the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us?</hi>

See <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No place or viſible Church hath any ſuch priviledge, but that ſinne will make it deſolate: for, no place hath ſuch promiſes as <hi>Zion, Jeruſalem, and the mountain of the houſe</hi> had, and yet they were to be <hi>plowed as a field, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The ſervants of God muſt be bold and faithful, not onely in ſpeaking againſt the ſins of the Rulers, but even againſt a Church having great priviledges, when ſhe is found in tranſgreſſion: for, this paſſage is recorded as a proof of <hi>Micah</hi>'s fidelity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.18. 3. It is our duty to look upon ſin, and to be affected with it, not only as procuring corrections upon our ſelves; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it hath an hand in drawing on calamities on the Church and Kingdom where we live; this he tells them: <hi>For your ſake</hi> Zion <hi>ſhal be plowed as a field, and Jeruſalem ſhal become heaps, and the mountaine of the houſe as the high places of the forreſt.</hi> 4 Univerſal defection of a Land, eſpecially of Rulers and Teachers in their Offices and Judicatories, will bring on ſpeedy deſolation, unleſſe that by repentance it be prevented, (as the execution of this threatning was in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> dayes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.18, 19.) <hi>For your ſakes</hi> Zion <hi>ſhal be plowed, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith he to the corrupt Rulers and Teachers, in regard their corruption had a chief hand in procuring this ruine, and could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the people in the like defection, to haſten the judgement. 5. Judgments on a backſliding Church are moſt ſevere and ſharp, howſoever there be moderation in them to the Elect; for, no leſſe is here threatned then being <hi>plowed as a field, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming heaps, and as the high places of the forreſt;</hi> So great a ſin is the contempt of mercy offered to a Church. 6. As for this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169976:63"/>part of their calamity, that the ground whereon the holy City and Temple ſtood <hi>was plowed as a field,</hi> albeit when it was firſt denounced in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> dayes, it was ſuſpended on their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.19. And albeit we find not that it was accompliſhed at the firſt deſtruction of the Temple; yet common hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that after the ſecond deſtruction thereof, it was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Romanes; who, according to their cuſtome, plowed up the very ground whereon the Temple had ſtood, in ſign of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al deſolation. So infallibly certain is the Word of God, that after ſo long a tract of time it will take effect; albeit upon repentance it had been delayed; yea, and after they had paſt through many troubles, and had been delivered, and ſo might think they had done with it, yet upon new ſin and provocation that ſentence is ſtill ſtanding againſt them, and at laſt takes effect.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, That however the Church of the Jewes was to be in great miſery for ſin; yet it ſhould come to paſſe in the dayes of the Meſſiah that the Church (called by the name of old <hi>Zion,</hi> or the <hi>mountain of the houſe,</hi> as beſt known to the Jewes) and the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as eminent and chief among the reſt, ſhould be glorious and exalted above every ſociety that is excellent in the world; as if the mountaine whereon the Temple ſtood, were made higher then any hill, or ſet upon the top of them: <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the Spirit of God is a Spirit of unity and doth not differ from himſelf in his manifeſtations to his ſervants; ſo it is a comfortable thing when the Meſſengers of God do concur and unite in bearing teſtimony to any Truth in the Church; for thus it was with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> who being contemporary, do preach the ſame things here; and <hi>Iſ</hi> 2. 2. God doth no ſooner afflict his people, but as ſoon mercies, to make up their loſſes come in his mind; and the Churches afflictions are never to be ſtudied, but when the promiſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her up are taken along in our thoughts; for, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the back of that threatning, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. this promiſe cometh forth, as teſtifying his affection, and for her to look upon with the other. 3. The Churches happineſſe and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is much in gracious promiſes, and to come in reſpect of performance: <hi>It ſhall come to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> ſaith the Lord: This was indeed eſpecially true under the Law, in compariſon of the days of the Goſpel; and yet even under the Kingdome of Chriſt her
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169976:64"/>felicity is yet to be compleated when eternity ſhall come; and ſhee is to live on hope of that. 4. The chiefe and great glory of the Church within time was reſerved for the dayes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and of the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleſh: The Church before, (however knowing and enjoying the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> by faith, yet) being kept under a paedagogie of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law, and the ſhadowes of good things to come: <hi>In the laſt dayes it ſhall come to paſſe, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 10.23, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. 5. The dayes of the Goſpel are the laſt dayes, wherein all things foretold by the Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompliſhed, we are daily to be expecting eternity, and the cloſure of time; for ſo is the time betwixt the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt called the <hi>laſt dayes,</hi> or evening of the world. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. 6. The true Church of Chriſt is firme and impregnable, and elevated above the world; for ſo much doth this name <hi>of the mountaine of the houſe eſtabliſhed</hi> teach us: A mountaine denotates what is ſtrong and fixed, and what is elevated above other things. 7. The Church of Chriſt, however in outward appearance baſe (as the little hill <hi>Moriah</hi> on which the Temple ſtood) yet ſhall be, and is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent and glorious above all worldly eſtates and kingdomes, and above all Idols and Idol-ſervices; for, <hi>the mountaine of the houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed on the top of the mountaines, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above the hills,</hi> that is, above potentates (which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to mountaines, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 51.25.) above Idols which are worſhipped on hills or high places; and generally, above all that is eminent in the world: This is accompliſhed, partly when the Church is made to riſe upon the ruines of kingdomes and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols which oppoſe her, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.12. partly when Kings bring their glory to her, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 60.10, 11. (which is yet more to be fulfilled when Antichriſt ſhall fall, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved,) their eminencies are but as hills to ſet her up higher: But chiefly this is daily accompliſhed in reſpect of Gods preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e in her, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68.15, 16. 8. The excellency and glory which God puts upon his Church, is not a tranſient or vaniſhing thing; but however ſhe may be toſſed, and duſt caſt upon her, yet her excellency will remaine; for, ſhe is not onely <hi>exacted,</hi> but <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neny.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond branch of this promiſe, is the increaſe and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church (which is both an effect, and an inſtance of her ſpiritual glory and eminency) in that people of all Nations
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169976:64"/>(as it is <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.2.) ſhall (not go up to earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but) embrace the Goſpel, and joyne themſelves unto the true Church, whoſe fervour in coming is held forth in their mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and upſtirrings to come unto the Church, for direction how to order their converſation; all which as it hath already been verified, ſo it will be yet more accompliſhed, when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles being converted ſhall profeſſe their communion in the Chriſtian Religion with converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhall receive from them a perfect directory for Gods ſervice, and joyn in faith and worſhip with them, when God ſhall remember his Covenant, and prove himſelfe to be <hi>the God of Jacob. Doct.</hi> 1 It is the glory of the Kingdome of Chriſt, that it is univerſal, and that he ſhall prevaile with thoſe who were enemies thereunto, to become ſubjects, and acknowledge the Church to be the Princeſſe of ſocieties, and ſhall perſwade even whole Nations under the Goſpel to become a Church to him, and a part of his kingdome; for, <hi>people ſhal flow unto it, and many Nations ſhal come.</hi> The Church ſhall not be confined within the bounds of <hi>Judea</hi> or of one Nation only; nor ſhal the party of a Nation only, but the whole Nation joyne. 2. Under the Goſpel the diſtinction and prerogatives of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are taken away, all have acceſſe unto the Church, and ſome of all ſorts wil come; for, <hi>people and many Nations ſhalt flow and come,</hi> as well as the Jewes. See <hi>Col</hi> 3.11. 3. The glory and priviledges of the Church of Chriſt, being wel ſeen, would make people not only come, but flow with zeal and fervour, and in great number to him, in her: for ſo much doth the word <hi>flowing</hi> teach us, that they ſhal flow as abundantly, and with as much fervour as rivers run downward. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. yea, a ſight of this would make Kings deſire to partake of the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts poor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 4. In a time of converſion, eſpecially of Nations to the Goſpel, and to Chriſt, there will be a willing and chearful people; for, ſo is it here, <hi>many Nations ſhall come, and ſay, Come, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. 5. Our willingneſs to come unto Chriſt in his Church, ought to be evidenced by ſtirring up one another to come to him; for, <hi>they ſhall ſay, Come, and let us go, &amp;c.</hi> 6 A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted people do yet ſtand in much need of mutual edification and ſtirring up of one another in their ſtations; for, ſo doth the practice of theſe converts teach us, <hi>Come, let us go up,</hi> ſay they. 7, True mutual edification conſiſts not in mutual
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169976:65"/>exhortations only, but eſpecially in practice, and walking ſo as may edifie and excite others; <hi>Come, and let us go;</hi> they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, who can rightly exhort others. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.21. 8. True converts muſt be drawn upward in their aime, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practice from the earth; and albeit there be ſeeds of good and willingneſſe in them, yet they will finde the way of godlineſs a ſtrait and ſteep path to their nature; Therefore their courſe gets the name of <hi>going up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob,</hi> alluding to their aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temple. 9. Such as draw neer unto God, and joyne themſelves to him in his Church, ought to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Covenant, wherin he hath ingaged himſelf to be gracious in his Chriſt to all who ſeek to him; for, <hi>they go up to the houſe of the God of Jacob;</hi> that is, he who hath entered in a Covenant with <hi>Jacobs</hi> poſterity, and with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſpirit. 10. That which is moſt eminent in a true convert, and which is firſt gained in one whoſe heart is touched, is their affectionate willingneſs to obey God: <hi>We will walk in his paths</hi> ſay they, their affection is gained, when yet they are to get teaching. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. 11. Affection toward God is not ſufficient for a peoples walking, to render their way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but they muſt have knowledge of the will of God alſo, to direct their path; for, <hi>He wil teach, and we wil walk,</hi> ſay they. 12. Every true convert is made ſenſible of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ignorance and proneneſs to errour, and becomes docible and willing to receive inſtruction: <hi>Let us go</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and he will teach us of his wayes;</hi> they account it a mercy to be taught; and that not what they like, or as they effect, but what is his will. 13. Albeit the Lord hath appointed a teaching Miniſtry in his Church, which his people ought and wil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet every true convert is taught of God: partly, while they hang not their faith on mens authority, but exalt God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to be the infallible Teacher and Law-giver in his Church, and do try if what men ſay, be agreeable to his mind; and partly, while they feele God in and by his appointed means, teaching truth effectually and perſwaſively to their hearts; <hi>Hee will teach us of his wayes,</hi> ſay they. See <hi>John</hi> 4 42. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.13. 14 As all knowledge of divine things ought not to reſt in contemplations, but ſtirre up to practice; ſo however men of much literal knowledge may be more prophane in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations then others; yet ſuch as are taught of God, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169976:65"/>acknowledg his Authority in the meanes of inſtruction, and feel the efficacy of his Spirit conveighing what is taught to their hearts, their knowledg will reſolve in practice: it being the Lords prerogative, to convince the conſcience, and ſubdue and ſtir up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to practiſe what is taught: <hi>He will teach us, and we wil walk in his paths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this promiſe the Prophet ſubjoynes a reaſon, why Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould ſeek to joyn with the Church; to wit, becauſe the doctrine of ſalvation ſhould go forth from the Jews, among all Nations, to ſtir them up to ſeek the Lord, and this light ſhall ſhine forth in the Church in all ages to invite Nations to come and ſeek teaching. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The glory of the Church of the New Teſtament conſiſts not in idle ceremonies, but in the profeſſion and holding forth of true doctrine according to the Word, which is the badge and mark of the true Church: for, <hi>the Law</hi> (or, generally the true <hi>doctrine,</hi> as the word in the Original bears) <hi>ſhall go forth out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from Ieruſalem,</hi> that it may ſhine in all the Churches of the Gentiles, and this is a part of the eminency of the mountain of the Lords houſe. 2. The Lord hath made it clear, that the Doctrine of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the days of the Meſſiah, was not to be treaſured up among the Jewes only as of old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, but to ſpread throughout the world; for, <hi>the Law ſhall go forth of</hi> Zion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3 The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel is the ſame for ſubſtance with what was in the Church of the Jewes, though clothed with new circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials. Therefore it is called a <hi>Law,</hi> alluding to the old name, and cometh from among them to us, though not from <hi>Sinai,</hi> cloathed with dark ſhadowes and fearful terrours; but from <hi>Zion,</hi> adorned with cleerneſſe, and ſeaſoned with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 4. As the Word of God publiſhed in his Church is the inſtrument of true converſion: ſo it is the meanes whereby Chriſt inlargeth his Kingdome, and will prevail in the world to perſwade Nations to joyne themſelves to him in his Church; therefore is this given as a reaſon of the inlargement of the Church, and activity of Converts; <hi>for the Law ſhall go forth of</hi> Zion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The next promiſe contains her peace and tranquillity (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out yet more the Churches glory) under Chriſts govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that God in his Son Chriſt ſhall by his Goſpel have and exerciſe a ſpiritual juriſdiction and kingdome in the world, whereby he ſhall ſubdue them to his obedience, and having ſubdued, ſhall govern them ſo, as to procure peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity to the Church, that the converted may ſerve God qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in their particular ſtations, and become uſeful each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This their condition is expreſſed in termes taken from the uſual practice of peaceable times, wherein men being out of uſe of war, do turne their weapons of offence into inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of husbandry and utility, and wherein men go about thoſe callings and abide abroad in the fields without fear of danger, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt coming with his Goſpel, is to reigne as a King, and have authority over thoſe who receive him; for, <hi>he ſhall judge among many people.</hi> 2. It is a truth to be much and frequently ſtudied, that Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is univerſal, his Church ſpread over the world, and he having power over all for her good; that he may have his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and every particular Church and believer be comforted in ſuch a head, and in hope of the enlargement of his dominion, when by Apoſtafie or perſecution it is confined to narrow bounds; therefore is it again promiſed; that <hi>he ſhal judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many people, and rebuke ſtrong Nations afar off;</hi> to wit, far from <hi>Judea,</hi> and meaning all people far and neer. 3. The Lord may deal very terribly with ſuch as he purpoſeth to do much good unto; he may convince, rebuke, and afflict them for ſin, that he may drive them to his mercy; for that is a part of his work in gathering a Kingdom, <hi>to judge and rebuke.</hi> 4. Albeit the Lord in gathering of his Church, do not make uſe of weapons of war, but only his Word with the reproofs and terrors thereof, yet that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169976:66"/>will ſuffice to ſubdue them to him, nothing in the creature being able to ſtand out againſt the Lord, convincing and rebuking for ſin; for, if he <hi>judge and rebuke many people and ſtrong Nations,</hi> they will feel it, and <hi>beat their ſwords into plowſhares, &amp;c.</hi> and come under his government. 5. This promiſe of great tranquillity and peace, is not ſo to be underſtood as if the Lord did condemn Chriſtians their undertaking of lawful wars; for, Magiſtrates bearing the ſword of Juſtice (which muſt oft-times be executed by force of armes) is the Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Nor are we ſo to underſtand it, as if the Church were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to enjoy outward peace and tranquillity; for, Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes that himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.34. Nor doth the godlies ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al peace in all troubles exhauſt the full ſcope of this promiſe. But the ſcope is to teach us, 1. The ſaving effect of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel upon men, is, when it daunts and ſubdues their corruptions, and ſo makes them, as tractable and plyable to the will of God; ſo, peaceably ſtudy to ſerve God in their ſtations, and to be uſeful each to other; for, when theſe ſtrong Nations are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, <hi>they beat their ſwords into plowſhares, &amp;c.</hi> Which are inſtruments of their lawful calling, and of utility to themſelves and others. 2. This taming of mens corruptions by the Goſpel, will appear farther, in that the Saints and converted will live at peace, in ſo far as they are renewed (otherwiſe a Saints cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as well as our own, may be on our tops,) and that there ſhall not be ſuch an enmity betwixt believing Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as was before the partition was taken down; in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi> 3. Whatever troubles the Church may meet with from enemies, yet ſhe ſhall give no cauſe nor occaſion thereof, albeit their corruption may take occaſion to raiſe troubles becauſe of the profeſſion of the Goſpel; for, the converted ſhall be peaceable men, <hi>and beat their ſwords into plowſhares, &amp;c.</hi> 4. In deſpite of all the power and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of enemies, the Church of God ſhall have even outward peace and tranquillity in ſo far as is needful and ſubſervient to their ſpiritual good, otherwiſe when it proves hurtful, it is better to want it, as the Church hath many times found in experience. And as the Lord hath often given taſtes of this to his Church: ſo it will be more fully accompliſhed when the fulneſs of the Gentiles and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be turned to the Lord, as ſometimes before in the Church; ſo, then <hi>they ſhall fit every man under his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169976:67"/>vine, and under his fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid. Doc.</hi> 6. The fidelity of God who promiſeth, is ſufficient to aſſure our hearts of the performance of greateſt things, as being omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and having all things under his power, and at his command, which may either promote or ſeem to impede the execution of his will: Therefore is this promiſe, which might ſeem improbable by reaſon of the great deſolation which was threatned ſhould come, ſealed with this: <hi>for the mouth of the Lord of hoſts hath ſpoken it.</hi>

                  <p>In the Parallel place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.5. inſtead of what is here, is contained an exhortation to the Jewes, that ſince the Church under the Meſſiah was to be glorious, they would faithfully cleave to God and true Religion in all their calamities, till theſe dayes ſhould come; and ſeeing the Gentiles were thus to flow in to Chriſt, they would not ſlip away, but be provoked to jealouſie, and come in to partake. And indeed the hope of the Church of God is ſo great and ſure, that it may well encourage men to be honeſt under any diſadvantage: and albeit this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation was not hearkened unto at the firſt Converſion of the Gentiles, yet the day will come, when it ſhall be effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11.25, 26. But <hi>Micah</hi> ſeems to hold forth further the reſolution of the Converts of Jewes and Gentiles under the Goſpel, to renounce all hereſies and ſects, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here conſtantly and zealouſly to God, and the Profeſſion of the Chrſtian Religion, exciting themſelves hereunto by the example of idolaters, who were pertinacious in their irreligious courſes: and this is a third evidence of the glory of the Church: and ground of encouragement to the godly, that inſtead of the manifold Apoſtaſies and pollutions with the wayes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, which appeared formerly in the Church of the Jewes, the Church of God, eſpecially <hi>Iſrael</hi> being converted, ſhould then prove conſtant in their Religion. <hi>Doc.</hi> 1. Conſtancy in adhering to the true Religion, is the great glory of a Church, and encouragement of the godly, to whom backſlidings are a ſad affliction, as here we are taught. 2. The Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169976:67"/>and Religion conſiſts in <hi>walking in the Name of the Lord,</hi> that is, in profeſſing and practiſing according to the revealed rule, which is <hi>his Name;</hi> not ſeeking to be wiſe above what is written, and going about theſe things in his ſtrength, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118.11. being furniſhed with encouragement from him; for, ſo <hi>his Name</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.5. is the light (to wit, of direction and conſolation) of the Lord. 3. Such as would walk in theſe pathes, and adhere to them, ought to make ſure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God by Covenant, and make uſe of this intereſt for daily influence, and ought to be filled with much affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Confederate Lord; <hi>Wee will walk in the Name of the Lord our God.</hi> 4. For right performance of our duty, there is much need alſo of frequently renewed reſolutions, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together motives to ſet us on edge; as here they gather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from idol-ſervers, and put on reſolutions; <hi>Wee will walk &amp;c.</hi> 5. Eternall reſolutions, or reſolutions of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conſtantly, are fit and beſeeming ſo high a duty as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Gods Name; <hi>we wil walk,</hi> ſay they, and <hi>walk for ever and ever.</hi> It being a way wherein there is no cauſe of wearying, and the benefit thereof being but in its prime, and fully to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when time and its contentments are ending. 6. Even in the dayes of the Goſpel, there are ſtill ſo many blindfolded and deluded, as not to ſee the glory of Chriſts Kingdome, but will pertinaciouſly follow their Idol-gods: for, there are, <hi>all people</hi> (that is, many who) <hi>will walk in the name of their god.</hi> 7. The Lords people ought (and by grace will) be ſo far from being ſhaken or drawn away by the multitude of men who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their true God, that idolaters their obſervancy and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their way ſhould give occaſion to the ſeekers of God to put on reſolutions of more exactneſſe; their blinde zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is no God, may teach us our duty toward the true God; for ſo doth this compariſon inſtituted teach, that not onely Chriſtians would not joyne with them in their way, but ſeeking theſe were ſo carefull and reſolute, much more ought they to be ſo in the right way; <hi>For al people wil walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> See <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>

                  <p>The fourth encouragement doth yet further evidence the glory of the Church, from the conſideration of her former miſery by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for ſin, which he would now make up, and of ſuch conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his Church, and Kingdome, over which he ſhould reigne for ever and ever. And however this promiſe be of generall verity, pointing out what baſe and contemptible like matter he will gather his Church of, yet it hath a ſpeciall relation to the preſently afflicted, and yet further to be afflicted Church of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> whom he comforts againſt all her afflictions and impediments that might cut off all hope of her reſtauration, by promiſing to gather them under the Goſpel, and make them a great Nation, and that Chriſt in his ſpiritual government ſhall conſtantly rule over them in their own land, after their converſion, or in the Church which was prefigured by <hi>Mount Zion. Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords afflicting of his Church doth in a ſpecial manner, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear her to his affection, and makes that ſhe ſhall not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, when mercies are a dealing; for, ſaith he, <hi>I wil aſſemble and gather her that I have afflicted:</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. 2. Great afflictions are no impediments to the Churches reſtitution, when the time of it comes, when Omnipotency is imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and when he in love remembers them in their low eſtate; for, ſuch as are ſo cruſhed with trouble, as they are made <hi>to halt,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>afflicted, driven out and caſt farre off,</hi> he can and will <hi>aſſemble and gather them, and make a remnant and ſtrong nation of them;</hi> that is, he wil preſerve a remnant and keepe them from total ruine in trouble, and at laſt reſtore and multiply them. 3. The glory of a Church reſtored, and the height of their felicity, is to have the Lord reigning and acknowledged as a King in all his prerogatives amongſt them; therefore it is added to their reſtitution, <hi>And the Lord ſhall reigne over them in Mount Zion.</hi> 4. The Churches King is not ſubject to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, nor ſuch a one as may be put from his kingdom, and leave them expoſed to hazard; but, <hi>the Lord ſhal reigne over them</hi> (and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169976:68"/>ſo protect them) <hi>from henceforth even for ever:</hi> which alſo imports that he will ſtill have ſubjects to reigne over.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here the Lord makes a more particular application of his comfortable promiſes unto the Church of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Promiſe be of general verity in a ſpiritual ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to the Catholick Church, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from above; yet the following verſes cleare, that it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſpecially of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> whom he here cals the <hi>tower of the flock,</hi> or <hi>Eder,</hi> of which <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.21. conceived to be a place neere, or in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in particular that part which was after called the <hi>ſheep-gate; and the ſtrong hold of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion,</hi> or <hi>Ophel,</hi> of which, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.3, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3 26. The firſt encouragement given to them for the comfort of the godly, is; that not only the Kingdome of Chriſt ſhould firſt begin at them, as the Hiſtory of the New Teſtament doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but that under Chriſt they ſhould be reſtored to their wonted dignity, reſembling that which they had of old enjoyed under <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>omon,</hi> before their rents and calamities. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord in gathering the univerſal Church hath an eſpecial regard to the <hi>Jewes</hi> his brethren; this doth appear in the ſpeciall allowance given to them in the promiſes concerning the Kingdome of Chriſt; of which, as the Lord gave them the firſt offer, ſo from them the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. gathers, that much mercy, ſhall yet be manifeſted unto them. 2. The Church of God is the receptacle and fold of all his true ſheep, wherein they gather themſelves under his government, and are environed with ſtrength for ſafety; ſo much is ſignified to us by theſe names given to <hi>Zion, The Tower of the flock and ſtrong hold.</hi> 3. The Lords own Application of ſpiritual comforts, is eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for his afflicted people; therefore the Lord counts it not enough to have propounded ample promiſes in general to the Church, which might anſwer all their caſes, and which they were bound to be applying; but he holds it alſo neceſſary to apply theſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169976:69"/>to the preſent Church in her need. 4. The glory of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is as great and greater ſpiritually, then ever the glory of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomons</hi> reigne was outwardly; all the valour, ſtrength and victories of <hi>David,</hi> all the riches, honour, and wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> even to admiration, and all the felicity of Iſrael under both, are but ſhadowes of that ſubſtance; therefore is it called <hi>the firſt dominion,</hi> that is, not ſo much the dominion at firſt offered to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as a dominion like the firſt flouriſhing times of Iſrael, 5. As Chriſt, to fulfil the truth of God, did make firſt offer of his Kingdome and Goſpel to the <hi>Iewes;</hi> ſo in due time he wil bring them under his dominion and ſpiritual Government; and will reſtore them to their wonted dignity thereby; uniting all Iſrael in him, the ſeede of <hi>David,</hi> as they were before the rent made by <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> adorning them emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently with the ſpirituall excellencies and priviledges of his Kingdome; if not alſo appearing gloriouſly for them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: for, ſaith he, <hi>Unto thee ſhal the firſt dominion come. the kingdome ſhal come to the daughter of Ieruſalem.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The next encouragement given to the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> is by ſhewing his mind concerning her troubles that were ſhortly to enſue; and that he may the more effectually comfort her, he very pathetically propounds her trouble, as if ſhe were now under it, and ſhewes unto her, that however in outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe had cauſe of bitter ſorrow, her King and Counſellers being to periſh in that calamity, ſhe being to be driven from the City and Temple which were to be deſtroyed, to ſojourn a ſpace in the fields, till the reſt of the Captivity were gathered, and then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169976:69"/>to be carried captive unto <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet upon better conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe might finde ſhee had no ſuch cauſe of fainting, but ought rather reſolutely to provide for, and couragiouſly to bear that trouble, ſeeing God ſhould be King and Counſeller to her, and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where ſhe might have leaſt hope, ſhe ſhould find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; and ſo he clears his mind to be this, that by trouble ſhe is going on toward deliverance. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The troubles of the Church may in their houre, prove very ſharp and bitter, as <hi>the pangs of a woman in travel, crying out aloud.</hi> 2. Albeit the Church of God in her trouble ſeeme to have reaſon for exceſſive ſorrow, and bitter diſcouragement, yet really it is not ſo, but ſhe hath ſtill ſome reaſon of encouragement, and ought to ſet about it; therefore whatever her troubles were, yet ſaith he, <hi>why doſt thou cry out aloud?</hi> as if he had ſaid, there is no reaſon for ſuch exceſſe in anxiety and ſorrow. The reaſons of this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal doctrine held forth in the Text, are as ſo many doctrines, all of them concluding that ſhe ought not to give way to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. 1. There is nothing the people of God want in trouble, which might be helpful or comfortable to them, but it wil be made up in God; for however her King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers were uſeleſſe, and enemies to her ſafetie in that ſtrait, and were afterward cut off for their ſins, and that ſhe might be emptied of all created comfort and helps, yet the Lord wil not admit that ſhe ſhould think ſhe wanted a King, while as he lived and reigned to preſerve her in her trouble, and in due time to re-eſtabliſh his Kingdom in her; ſo much doth this ſharp queſtion teach, <hi>Is there no King in thee? Is thy Counſeller periſhid?</hi> 2 As the Lord ſeeth it oft times fit not to remove, but continue and increaſe a peoples trouble; (for they were to <hi>be in pain, to go out of the city, dwel in the field, and go to Babylon:</hi>) ſo the people of God in ſuch caſes ought to arme themſelves with reſolution for ſuch lots, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by diſcouragement to make their owne croſſe heavy, which is all they can doe: ſo much are we taught, in that, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he reproves their cries, v, 9. yet, ſaith he, <hi>be in pain;</hi> which doth not only import an aſſuring of them that the trouble was to come, nor yet only a conceſſion, that it is no marvel they have pain, and ſorrow, but a command alſo to ſet themſelves reſolutely to bear it, as they are commanded to build houſes in <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 29.4, 5, 6, and to make their captivity as comfortable as lawfully they may. 3. The right pondering of the fruit which the Lord brings out of the troubles of his people may help to cruſh diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169976:70"/>under them; <hi>labour to bring forth like a woman in travel.</hi> He ſets her out in her trouble, as travelling in birth of ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to make her forget her ſorrow, which ſhe ſhould minde much, and preſſe after. See <hi>John</hi> 16.21, 22. 4. The Lords ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection towards his people, eſpecially under trouble, may be a great lenitive to their bitterneſſe: Therefore is ſhee here called the <hi>daughter of Zion,</hi> which is a ſtile of tenderneſſe. A room in his heart will make an affliction to be no affliction, or very tolerable. 5. Every ſtep of the people of God in affliction is a ſtep toward deliverance: and the utmoſt degree of affliction, is the door next to deliverance, ſo much doth the ſcope and drift of this place teach; <hi>the Church going out of the City, and dwelling in the field,</hi> was going toward deliverance, and when ſhee went even to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where in outward appearance ſhee might have loſt hope, yet, <hi>there ſhall ſhee be delivered,</hi> and is neerer to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance there then in the holy City. Theſe things, rightly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, may take away much ſeeming ground of diſcouragement under trouble. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The Lord is to be eyed as undertaker for the performance of improbable — like promiſes, which may cauſe all difficulties to vaniſh; Therefore after that promiſe, <hi>There ſhalt thou be delivered,</hi> is ſubjoyned, <hi>There the Lord ſhal redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies:</hi> when he undertakes, it wil be eaſie to raiſe a <hi>Cyrus</hi> and make him do it. 4. While as the Lord promiſes in delivering to <hi>redeem them,</hi> it teacheth: 1. That the Lord wil reckon kindred with, and intereſt in his afflicted people, that hee may appear for them; for it was the part of the neerſt in kindred to <hi>redeem,</hi> and the word in the Originall intimates ſo much. 2. That they having by ſin ſold themſelves into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50.1. Chriſt, by the price to be paid to juſtice for the Elect among them, ſhould procure their deliverance alſo, and of the viſible Church for their ſake: All temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to the children of God, flowing from that eternall Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſin, and as an appendix to the new Covenant, and the viſible Church getting deliverance for the Elects ſake among them. 3. That for enemies, who had captivated them, as they had ſold themſelves to them for nought; ſo they ſhould be actually aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto liberty without any price, ſave onely ſtroakes to the unjuſt poſſeſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52 3.</p>

The true Church hath the moſt enemies of any ſociety; for, <hi>many Nations are gathered.</hi> 2. It is uſefull for the Church to remark what enemies intend, and what our troubles would ſeem to threaten, to the end that more of God may be ſeen in delivering; for this end is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the enemies deſigne premitted to the conſideration of the purpoſe of God: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.1, 2, 3, 4. 3. As the wicked ſee no priviledg the Church of God hath, why ſhe may not be dealt with as other prophane ſocieties: ſo the greateſt bitterneſſe the people of God have in their affliction, is, that hereby not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they, but their priviledges are trampled under foot by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for, it is the ſad ſight they get of enemies deſignes, when they hear them ſay, <hi>Let her be defiled,</hi> or <hi>prophaned.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.9, 10, 11. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.15. 4.

Enemies are not permitted to run at randome in their wayes, but the Lord hath an effectual and wiſe Providence over-ruling in all their deſignes; for, in all of them he hath <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> and therefore we are not to eye much their brags, but looke to him who ſets bounds to them, and ſits at the helme of Providence. 2. The Lords holy purpoſes of good to his people, and wrath to his enemies, may be ſo conveighed in deep wiſdome, and ſo contrary to the way of carnal reaſon and probability, that they will not be ſeene by any natural eye, nor can be diſcerned by enemies themſelves, who are given up to run blindfold upon their own ruine: <hi>They know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand they his counſel.</hi> See <hi>Pſa.</hi> 92 6, 7. 3. In one and the ſame action God may have an holy worke of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and men their wicked intents and ſinful courſes, they being carried on without an eye to his revealed will, which is the rule of duty; nay, not to his providence either, but meerly for their own ends; and he making uſe of the ſame work of theirs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach them, and bring about his purpoſes; for in this enterpriſe, <hi>They gather themſelves</hi> for a ſinful end, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And God <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth them as ſheaves</hi> for an holy purpoſe. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. 4. The Lords end in letting enemies looſe upon the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her trial from them, is to ripen and fit them for judgement; for, <hi>he ſhal gather them as the ſheaves unto the floore;</hi> to wit, to be trampled under foot, as their corn was by beaſts that tread it out. See <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.33. Such as the Lord abhorreth, are let come in oppoſition to his people; and they are ripened for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereby, partly while their cup is thus filled to the brim, which in other tranſgreſſions might be long a filling; partly, while he lets affliction out upon his Church, that ſecret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169976:71"/>may diſcover themſelves, and ſo be brought to the floore for threſhing. 5. Chriſts Church is not to look what ſhe hath in her ſelf for oppoſing theſe enemies that aſſault her, and for bringing about the mercies intended for her; but what he will make her, and how ſhe ſhall be enabled to ſet againſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all difficulties; and in the faith thereof, ought cheerfully to ſet to her duty; <hi>Ariſe,</hi> ſaith he, as to one laid by dead or diſcouraged, <hi>and threſh, O daughter of Zion: for I wil make thy borne</hi> (to puſh) <hi>iron, and thy hoofe braſſe,</hi> to threſh as was their cuſtome, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. Upon theſe terms, the weak may ſay, I am ſtrong. 6. The Churches victory over her enemies wil in due time be made compleat, and in due time Iſrael, and the Church of God ſhall have their many enemies under their feet, either as ruined, or true ſubjects, or tributaries; This is imported not only in that ſhe ſhall tread them with her <hi>hoofes,</hi> and <hi>heat in pieces many people,</hi> but in that <hi>their gain ſhal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated,</hi> or <hi>devoted,</hi> which alludeth to that of <hi>Jericho, Joſh.</hi> 6.17, 19. wherein there was a compleat victory given to Iſrael. 7. The glory of all the victories of the Church, and of the benefits obtained thereby, ought to be given to God onely; for ſo much alſo doth the <hi>conſecrating of their gain and ſubſtance</hi> (as the corn that is threſhed out) <hi>to the Lord,</hi> import: that as <hi>Jericho</hi> was offered to the Lord, and it was a ſin in <hi>Achan</hi> to take ought of the conſecrated things; ſo it ſhould be a ſin in the Church to exalt her ſelf, and not the Lord only, in and by theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. 8. The Lord onely muſt be the undertaker to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the glory of all his wonderful dealing for his people, and make them forth-coming to his praiſe, and will alſo cruſh and ſuppreſſe whatſoever among his people would come betwixt him and his glorious deſign: <hi>and I wil conſecrate their gain,</hi> is the Lord ſpeech, though afterward he ſpeak of himſelfe in the third perſon. 9. The Lord, by his vengeance on the Churches enemies, will have himſelfe manifeſted and known in the world; and by his gracious dealing for his Church, and bleſſing her endeavours, will have himſelf acknowledged through the earth, and the kingdomes of the earth to become his; for, ſo much doth the ſtile, <hi>the Lord of the whole earth,</hi> teach, that as he is ſo indeed, ſo not onely by theſe victories ſhal he be known to be ſo through the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.16. and 59.13. but ſhall at laſt have his dominion acknowledged and ſubmitted to more generally through the earth.</p>

                  <p>HEre is foretold the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> and the ignominious and baſe uſage of their Kings and Judges, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.7, 18, 19, 20, 21. as a fore-runner of the taking away of the Scepter from <hi>Judah,</hi> to make way for Chriſts birth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. which began to be accompliſhed in the Babyloniſh captivity, in that none of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> ſwayed the Kingly Scepter after that time, all which the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells by way of defiance given by the Church to their roving enemies to do their utmoſt endeavours, according as God by his effectual Providence ſhould permit them to enterpriſe and execute, in regard that however <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were taken, and their rulers ſo abuſed, yet they had a King to come out of deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Bethlehem, ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts ordinary harbingers and forerunners, when he is to come with mercies to his Church, are afflictions to fit them for ſuch manifeſtations; for, ſo is this deſtruction premitted to the promiſe of Chriſts birth and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Afflictions are Gods means to purge out and cut off many whom he will not make partakers of thoſe mercies, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite others to repentance for ſin obſtructing theſe mercies, to endear them to his heart, and make them capable of theſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169976:72"/>conſolations, which in their proſperity they would readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe. 2. Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the true promiſed Meſſiah, who was to be raiſed to rule his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when their Judges and Rulers were ignominiouſly intreated, and put down from their Authority, who was held forth in the promiſe for the Churches comfort, when this deſolation began in their captivity, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited when it was in completeing, their Kingdom then being by the Romanes reduced into the form of a Province, <hi>Herod,</hi> an <hi>Idumean</hi> made King, the power of their Judicatories reſtrained before, and in the time of his Miniſtry, and ſhortly after his Aſcenſion, their City, Commonwealth and Temple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly overthrown. So much doth this verſe, compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and the accompliſhment in the New Teſtament teach us. 3. The Church of God, rightly pondering her advantages in him, may in him give a defiance to enemies utmoſt malice, ſeeing they can do no hurt but what he will make up with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor can they hinder any of his gracious purpoſes toward his people: So much doth this manner of ſpeech directed to the <hi>Caldeans</hi> teach, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w gather thy ſelf in troops, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion backed with authority and great power, doth nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the hainouſneſs thereof before the Lord; for, albeit the <hi>Caldeans</hi> had ordered armies marching and acting at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Authority, and they would eſteem what they ſubdued to be lawful conqueſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.24. yet the Lord ſtiles <hi>Caldea, O daughter of troops;</hi> or, as the word ſignifies, <hi>bands of robbers;</hi> to ſhew that their great conqueſts were but great oppreſſions. 5. Whatever good the Lord brings out of the afflictions of his Church, yet ſhe may expect to be diſtreſſed with them in the mean time; for, <hi>He hath laid ſiege againſt us,</hi> ſhall the people ſay, importing that all the Land ſhould be ſubdued, the City beſieged, and the inhabitants thereof made to acknowledge their felt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. 6. The contempt and injury done to Authority and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; under whom a people may be kept from confuſion, and the Church protected, is a ſpecial ingredient in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the viſible Church; for, they do reſent it as a part of the affliction, <hi>They ſhall ſmite the Judge of Iſrael:</hi> ſo alſo doth <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> lament the ſtroake even of <hi>Zedekiah, Lam.</hi> 4.20. 7. As Princes and men in Authority being wicked, do diſhonour God more then others, by reaſon of their greatneſſe, and it is their eminency, which oft-times makes them ſo much ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: ſo the Lord in his righteouſneſs makes contempt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169976:73"/>to be their puniſhment, they are ſmitten <hi>with a rod on the check,</hi> which is a contemptible ſtroak, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.30. See <hi>Job</hi> 12.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.40.</p>

                  <p>Followeth the conſolation of the godly, from a Promiſe of Chriſt to be the Ruler in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> whoſe birth as man is foretold to be in <hi>Beth-lehem Ephratah</hi> the City of <hi>David,</hi> (whoſe heire he was) in the Tribe of <hi>Judah, Judg.</hi> 17.7. called <hi>Ephratah, Gen.</hi> 35.19. and 48.7. to diſtinguiſh it from another <hi>Beth-lehem</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Zebulun, Joſh.</hi> 19.10, 15. By means whereof it is likewiſe foretold, that this City though baſe in reſpect of others, ſhould become great and indeed famous; and leſt any ſhould look on this Ruler as only man, and beginning to be at his incarnation; therefore it is alſo declared that he is the Son of God, whoſe generation is eternal. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and manifeſtation of himſelf, is the true Churches chief comfort in all her troubles; for, therefore is his birth ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the deſolation mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. as the ſalve for that ſore. 2. Mercies manifeſted to any place or perſon, ought to be taken notice of, and marked, that they may be thankfully acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uſe made of them: Therefore is the ſpeech directed to the City; that they may conſider the priviledge, <hi>and thou Beth-lehem-Ephratah.</hi> 3. Chriſt uſeth ordinarily to make uſe of, and honour moſt ſuch things as are leaſt conſiderable in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance; As here, he will not be born in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in <hi>Beth-lehem Ephratah,</hi> which is <hi>little among the thouſands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> that is, a ſmall City of few people, and governed by mean Rulers in compariſon of other Cities. The ſpeech relates to the diviſion of the people by thouſands under the government of their ſeveral Rulers, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.20. And therefore, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.6. in ſtead of <hi>thouſands,</hi> the Princes are named who governed them; See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29. 4. Smalleſt and baſeſt things, by enjoying of Chriſt, or having relation to him, do become great;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169976:73"/>Therefore conſidering the event, this text is read thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Thou art not the beaſt among the Princes of Judah;</hi> and the Hebrew text here may be read by way of queſtion, which includes a denial; <hi>Art thou little, &amp;c?</hi> No verily, though thou ſeem to be ſo; <hi>For out of thee ſhall come forth, &amp;c.</hi> 5. The Lord in his providence uſeth to bring about the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his promiſes in ſtrange and wonderful manner; As may be ſeen in the accompliſhment of his promiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp;c. Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> dwelling in <hi>Nazareth</hi> all the time after the Conception of Chriſt, and little thinking on a removal: at the period of his birth, are charged by the Emperours Edict, to go up to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that ſo the Word of the Lord might not fail, and that the prediction concerning the Meſſiah might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. 6. Chriſt is Ruler and King in his Church, he will be acknowledged to have dominion, and will performe the duties incumbent to a faithful Ruler; <hi>He ſhall come forth, that is, to be Ruler in Iſrael.</hi> 7. Chriſt in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Office, as he is a King acting for God the Father, ſo doth the Lord eſpecially allow of him, and will maintain and deſend him and his Kingdom; <hi>He ſhall come forth to me,</hi> ſaith the Lord. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2, 6. 8. Chriſt the Mediatour is not only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Man, but that the ſame Chriſt born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in the fulneſſe of time, is alſo true God begotten of the Father from all eternity; and ſo is God and Man in one perſon; for, <hi>He</hi> (that ſame individual perſon, though not according to one and the ſame nature) <hi>who cometh forth of Bethlehem-Ephratah, He,</hi> I ſay, it is <hi>whoſe goings forth have been from of old,</hi> that is, <hi>from everlaſting,</hi> or, <hi>the dayes of eternity,</hi> as the Original hath it. 9. Chriſts eternal generation as God, is ſuperexcellent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible; Therefore it is called <hi>goings forth,</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, to ſhew its excellencie, wherein all excellencies, and infinitely more then we can comprehend are ſummed up, though I do not ſeclude, but that herein both his eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eternal deſignation to the Office of Mediatour, may be imported.</p>

                  <p>The threatening and promiſe in the former verſes are conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the way of bringing about this mercy is further explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, that he would give up that Church unto her enemies hands, to be vexed as a woman in travel, till Chriſt be born of that Nation, or of a Virgin among them; and then ſhould all his ſcattered brethren return unto, and be joyned in one body with the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was in part accompliſhed when the Gentiles were ingrafted in the Olive, and ſhall be yet more, when the ſalvation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after their long rejection, ſhall be a reſurrection from the dead to the world, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in to Chriſt, and joyn with them. The Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> had indeed a birth after her paine, at her deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but that was but a forerunner of a more joyful bringing forth of Chriſt the Author of her ſpiritual deliverance, until which time ſhe was for the moſt part under the power of ſtrangers, and did not at all recover the wonted dignity ſhe enjoyed before the Captivity, and therefore ſhe is ſaid to be <hi>given up</hi> until that time. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Church had need of great troubles to prepare her for Chriſt and his ſpiritual Kingdom; for, as all their troubles will not exhauſt his treaſure: ſo it is needful by afflictions to make them ſenſible of ſin, to fit them for him; and it was needful to take away from the Church of the <hi>Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The great ground of confidence that the Church hath for not periſhing in her troubles, is, that ſhe is to bring forth Chriſt; <hi>He will give them up until the time that ſhe which travelleth hath brought forth,</hi> wherein is held forth, not only that their ſorrows ſhould reſolve in joy, as the paine of a woman in travel when ſhe brings forth; but becauſe ſhe is to bring forth, therefore ſhe ſhall not periſh, however ſhe be given up, but her ſorrowes ſhall have a period. This was the promiſe that might aſſure <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> could not periſh, ſeeing Chriſt was not yet born in her, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 7 4. &amp; is yet a ground of aſſurance that Chriſts Catholick Church ſhall not ceaſe in the world, becauſe ſhe hath Chriſt myſtical to bring forth. 3. Chriſt is a true brother and kinſman to all his people, and makes them to be brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; for, they are the <hi>remnant of his brethren.</hi> 4. Albeit no effects of Chriſts eſpecial love appear toward a man, ſo long as he is unconverted, yet he hath a relation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169976:74"/>his Elect, and loveth them from all eternity; for, <hi>the remnant of his brethren,</hi> are the Elect Gentiles then unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who are his brethren in reſpect of his eternal love in election, and of his purpoſe to make them brethren by Converſion, and ſo give them actual right to the priviledge, and a comfortable look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to this purpoſe of good toward them, which was in his heart from all eternity. 5. All Chriſts elected brethren ſhall undoubtedly be converted and brought in to him; for, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes for it, that the <hi>remnant of his brethren ſhall returne.</hi> 6. As all the Gentiles have right unto the Covenant and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by flying in to Chriſt, and in him, ſerving themſelves heirs to the ſpiritual promiſes made to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and being ingraffed in that ſtock where they were; ſo the full fruit of Chriſts incarnation is not accompliſhed, till <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo be brought in, and both they and the Gentiles be joyned in one body; for, this promiſe, <hi>the remnant of his brethren ſhall return unto,</hi> (or, <hi>together with) the children of Iſrael,</hi> imports, both that the Gentiles are brought in to the ſtock of the Iſraelitiſh Church, and that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be brought in; to whom and with whom the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall return: 7. That which is propounded as matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a promiſe, may be much miſtaken and ſtumbled at when it is ſeen in performance; for, here it is a comfortable promiſe to the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that <hi>the remnant of his brethren ſhall return to the children of Iſrael,</hi> and ſo be one ſheepfold; and yet when it began to be performed, they repined, even believers of them for a long time: But in its full accompliſhment they will look otherwiſe upon it.</p>

Chriſt is a painful and watchful Shepherd and overſeer of his Church, and ſouls of his people, and will bear out in his charge; for, <hi>he ſhall ſtand,</hi> imports both vigilancy, as being alwayes on his feet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.4. and ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that his government ſhall endure for ever. 2. God will both feed his people with wholeſome food, and not ſuffer them to ſtarve, and will rule and direct them in their wayes, and theſe two are to be conjoyned by us, that if we expect his feeding, we muſt ſubmit to his Government; for, the word in the Original im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports both, <hi>he ſhall feed</hi> and <hi>rule.</hi> 3. Chriſt hath alſufficiency of endowments for diſcharging his duty to his flock, which ſhall gloriouſly ſhine forth in the performance thereof; for, <hi>He ſhall feed in the ſtrength of the LORD, and in the Majeſty of the Name of the LORD;</hi> that is, he ſhall have divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to carry him thorough, and the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily, ſhall gloriouſly manifeſt it ſelf in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, caring for, and maintaining his flock againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: See, <hi>John</hi> 10 28, 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. 4. Albeit Chriſt as God have power and glorious Majeſty equally with the Father, yet as Mediatour he is alſo furniſhed for his calling, by vertue of the Covenant of Redemption, paſt betwixt the Father and him concerning the Redemption and Salvation of the Elect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Father doth undertake to furniſh him with all endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments needful for his Office, and to give him ſucceſſe; and he undertakes to be faithful for attaining that end, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he performes; for, it is <hi>in the ſtrength and Name of the LORD,</hi> who is <hi>his God that he feeds,</hi> with whom he is in Covenant, and whoſe ſervant he is in this work. 5. By Chriſts care and Providence, his flock and people ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and protected, ſo as they ſhall perſevere, and be out of danger of periſhing, for. <hi>He ſhall feed or rule, and they ſhall abide.</hi> 6. Chriſts care of and for his Church, if it were well ſeen, would make him famous and precious, as an ointment poured out, to invite others to come under his yoke, and it is his prerogative to have an univerſal Government and Kingdom over <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> throughout the earth, which he will ſtill proſecute till he obtain all that is in his Charter; for, <hi>He ſhall be great to the ends of the earth,</hi> imports all theſe. See, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.23. 7. The Converſion of ſouls unto Chriſt, and bringing them under his yoke, tends to the ſetting forth of the greatneſſe of Chriſt, and the converſion of many doth ſet out his greatneſſe the more, who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169976:75"/>doth draw all theſe, doth care for them, and to whoſe fulneſs they flow and depend upon, and it ſhould be the care of all who are converted, in their expreſſions and carriage to commend and ſet him forth as great and ſuperexcellent: therefore is the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdome deſcribed from this effect of it, <hi>He ſhall be great to the ends of the earth.</hi> 8.

It is a great bleſſing upon a land when the Lord furniſheth them with able men for government and rule in all exigents; for that is <hi>Iſraels</hi> mercy to have ſuch to employ, and they are the means of their peace and ſafety: <hi>We,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſhall raiſe</hi> (or call and ſend out) <hi>ſhe herds and principal men:</hi> where their Princes are called <hi>ſhepherds</hi> with relation to the people as a flock. 5. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church, do oppoſe her alwayes to their own great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage in the end: for, the Church ſhall not only defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but <hi>they ſhall waſte the land of Aſſyria with the ſword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof,</hi> or their borders, <hi>or with their own ſwords.

                  <p>The ſimilitude of <hi>Dew</hi> made uſe of here, leads us to a two-fold interpretation of this paſſage. 1. That the Lords bleſſing of the reſt, given by theſe deliverances to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhall make her to multiply and flouriſh marvellouſly, as the dew and rain fals down in great abundance, ſuddenly and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without humane induſtry; and thus the ſimilitude is uſed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. 2. That the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall not only flouriſh themſelves, but be inſtruments of the flouriſhing and increaſe of the Church among the Nations, as the Lord is the principal refreſher and fructifier of his Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his operations are compared to dew and raine, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6. So they ſhall be inſtrumentally as dew and raine to many Nations; that is, being furniſhed with the Spirit from above, and with refreſhing doctrine, they ſhall water them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. as dew and raine doth the ground, and ſo conquer them to the Kingdom of Chriſt, and be inſtruments of their fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and bleſſings to them.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe interpretations agree in one, to hold forth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous increaſe of the Church, either of <hi>Iſrael</hi> her ſelf, or of the Gentiles alſo by her means, as another fruit of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt over them, and may ſafely be taken both in here. From the firſt interpretation, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That afflictions may make many ſad and ſore breaches on a Church, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover out of them, for they are now brought to <hi>the remnant of Jacob.</hi> 2. The Lord can eaſily when he pleaſeth, reſtore his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken people, and make them increaſe, as admirably and incredibly as their decay was ſingular, and wil ſo do when they return to him: for, <hi>the remnant ſhall be as a dew, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The Lords ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſpenſations towards his afflicted people, will make them admirable and remarkable to all people, and above them; for, <hi>they ſhall be as dew in the midſt of many people,</hi> imports that they ſhould be conſpicuous, and exalted above all the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thereby: See, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.29. 4. Reſt and deliverance from troubles is then a bleſſing to the Church, when it is followed with fruitfulneſs and increaſe of the Church; for, ſo this promiſe is ſubjoyned to that, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. as a compleating thereof. See, <hi>Act</hi> 9.31. From the ſecond interpretation, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Church of God is a bleſſing to the world, if they forſake not their own mercy; partly, in that ſhe is a means of bringing bleſſings on every place where ſhe gets ſhelter and protection; and partly, in that ſhe is by her Miniſtery a means of mens converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting ſtill more and more to Chriſt, for which there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169976:77"/>here, <hi>She ſhall be in the midſt of many people as dew, &amp;c.</hi> See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.24. 2. The greateſt good that can be done unto the world, is to be a means of their converſion, and of bringing down ſpiritual bleſſings upon it; for, ſo is here implied, that the Church ſhall be as <hi>dew and rain</hi> upon them, which are choiceſt bleſſings. 3. All the ſpiritual felicity of a people, and the efficacy of the means bringing it about, is of God, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; for, it is as <hi>the dew and ſhowres that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the ſons of men,</hi> that is, that depends not on humane induſtry: See, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. 4. The means of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſpecially the Word preached and accompanied with the power of the Spirit (which God hath placed in his Church,) are as <hi>dew and ſhowres:</hi> 1. Becauſe as dew is the preſage of a fair day, ſo theſe means do flow from the favour of God toward the Elect, and are an evidence thereof. 2. As dew and ſmall rain are but ſmall things, and yet have great effects, ſo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with the Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. 3 Dew and raine cannot be hindered by men, no more doth the power of the Word depend on mens conſent. 4 Dew and rain makes fruitful, ſo is every true Convert made by the Word and Spirit. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. A converted perſon or people, joyning themſelves to the true Church, come under a ſweet yoke, and under the drop of many bleſſings; for, ſo doth the ſimilitude alſo teach, that as their converſion is by this dew; ſo being converted, they ſhall conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy thereof, and their fleece ſhall be wet with his dew, when other places are dry: 6 <hi>Iſrael</hi> being converted to Chriſt ſhall be the means of bleſſings, and of much converſion to the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles; for, it is <hi>the remnant of Jacob that ſhall be in the midſt of many people as dew, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Another fruit of the government of Chriſt over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a fruit of their deliverance, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. is, that all their neighbour-enemies who are not brought in, they ſhall be dreadful to them, as a Lion is to other wilde beaſts, who tears his prey, and none dare interpoſe.

The taking away of all their humane confidences, ſuch as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, chariots, cities and ſtrong holds, wherein they confided of old, and deſpiſed his threatenings. 2. The cutting off of devilliſh arts and idolatrous confidences, ſuch as witchcraft, divinations, idols and groves for worſhip, which were much uſed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, theſe were all to be deſtroyed and purged away by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come on <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhortly after this prophecie; and in the time of their reſtitution, it is promiſed here that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be a people ſtript of all confidences, that they may depend on God, and a people worſhipping the true God only in a pure way: and being put in that condition, he promiſeth remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able victories over the heathen their enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt will have nothing ſeen in his Churches protection and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance but himſelf only, nor will he make uſe of any thing which might ſeem to obſcure his glory in doing all: therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might ſeem to challenge any of that glory, muſt <hi>in that day be cut off:</hi> See, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12, 13. 2. Humane helps confided in, prove a great hinderance of deliverance: therefore <hi>Cities, Horſes, &amp;c. will he cut off,</hi> not only by judgements to come on that people, but even <hi>in that day</hi> of reſtitution, they will be laid by as impediments. 3. Confidence in outward things is idolatry: Therefore, here their <hi>cities, horſes, chariots,</hi> (to wit, as they are depended on) are ranked in with witchcrafts and idols. 4. It is rare to ſee a people enjoying outward things that may ſeem to promiſe any thing unto them, and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in them; this is evident in that their <hi>cities, chariots, &amp;c:</hi> muſt be <hi>cut off:</hi> they can hardly enjoy them and acknowledg God as becomes them. 5. When the Lord is pleaſed to deprive his people of probable means of help, and calleth them to depend on him, it is a pledge of his appearing in an eminent way for them: for, their <hi>cities, &amp;c. being cut off,</hi> ver. 10, 11. <hi>ſo will he deſtroy their enemies,</hi> as the latter part of <hi>ver.</hi> 14. ought to be read, as

There are no evil courſes but the Church of God, how reformed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is to be afraid of falling into them. 7. Theſe devilliſh cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and corruptions in worſhip do hinder the Lords appearance for his people: for, theſe muſt be <hi>cut off,</hi> that he may do for them. 8. The cutting off of idolatry and wicked courſes is a work of the Lords own hand: it is he who oft-times deſtroyes them by ſore plagues: and it is he only who can baniſh theſe things out of mens hearts: <hi>I,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>will cut off witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts out of thy hand:</hi> or make thee not to practiſe it, <hi>I will cut off thy graven images, &amp;c.</hi> 9.

Even inſenſible creatures are, ſo to ſay, more fit to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to then an obdurate people, and will bear witneſſe againſt them; for, therefore (beſide other reaſons inſinuate on <hi>chap.</hi> 1, 2. are <hi>the mountaines and ſtrong foundations of the earth called</hi> to in this proceſſe; they keep ſtill their obediential ſubjection to their Creatour, and do tremble if he threaten, whereas <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſtupid; and withal, theſe had ſometime been ſhaken and diſcovered for the good of <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 18.15. and 114.3, 4. and therefore might beare witneſſe againſt their ingratitude. 5. A backſliding people are for the moſt part dull of hearing, and plagued with obſtinacie, and cannot be ſenſible of their caſe and danger; therefore is the diſpute repeated again, and they called to hear, <hi>Hear ye now what the Lard ſaith.</hi> 6.

                  <p>Followeth the pleading of the controverſie, wherein God firſt appears, and challengeth them for their ungrateful departing from him and his obedience, which he proves by purging himſelf of, any wrong done to them, ſhewing that they had nothing to ſay againſt his diſpenſation toward them, and nothing to lay to his charge wherefore they ſhould have forſaken him, charging their conſciences, that as he had called the mountaines to witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; ſo they would declare, if they had any injury on his part to complain of, and would bring out any thing they had to ſay, to clear themſelves of that crime of ingratitude. <hi>Dect.</hi> 1. It is the Lords love to his people that maketh him challenge them for forſaking him, and this ſhould make the challenge affect their hearts, and will aggravate their guilt if it do not. So much doth this ſtile, <hi>O my people,</hi> prefixed to the challenge, teach us. 2. The Church of God by her backſliding, doth raiſe an evil
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169976:80"/>report on God, as if he dealt not well with his people, and as if he were not eaſie to ſerve, for his enquiring, <hi>what have I done unto thee? wherein have I wearied thee?</hi> imports that their backſliding ſaid in effect, he had done them injury, and wearied them with rigorous ſervice. 3. However our corruptions do ſnuffe and weary in Gods ſervice, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. yet there can be no true cauſe ſhewed why any ſhould chooſe to forſake God, but rather ſhould cleave unto him, ſeeing his commands are not grievous, his yoke eaſie, trials ſent by him not above meaſure, puniſhments not above deſerving, and a Mediator ready to undertake for his people in all exigents. Therefore the Lord will have it diſputed, and will have the conſciences of backſliders to clear him: <hi>wherein have I wearied thee? teſtifie againſt me:</hi> See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5, 3. 4. To forſake the Lord without cauſe, and when men have nothing to lay to his charge, wherefore they do it, is great ingratitude; for, this is the ſcope of the challenge, that fince they could lay nothing to his charge, and yet turned away from him, they could not ſhun the crime of ingratitude.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>A further proof of his challenge for their ingratitude, is taken from his mercies towards them, whereby he further vindicates himſelf, and proves that they were ſo far from having any harſh uſage to lay to his charge, wherefore they did forſake him: that on the contrary, he had manifeſted many rare and ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours toward them, which did aggravate their fault: This proof he cleares from ſeveral inſtances. The firſt inſtance is, his redeeming them from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that when <hi>Egypt</hi> dealt moſt hardly with them, and had made them bond-men, although the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themſelves ought rather to have been ſlaves, as coming of curſed <hi>Cham, Gen.</hi> 9.25. A ſecond inſtance is taken from his conducting them through the wilderneſſe, giving unto them a well-ſetled government and faithful Governours, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the State, to give laws from Gods mouth, and to conduct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Aaron</hi> to be Prieſt, and <hi>Meriam</hi> their ſiſter to inſtruct the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in that extraordinary time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Mercies
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169976:80"/>received do contribute much to aggravate the defection of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo much doth this inſtancing of mercies in a time of defection teach. See, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Our delivery from bondage ſpiritual or temporal, inward or outward, that we may ſerve the Lord, ought to be an eternal bond upon the delivered to be for God: therefore, their bringing out of the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> (a ſhadow of ſpiritual deliverance by Jeſus Chriſt) wherein God had manifeſted himſelf gloriouſly, is brought to remembrance, though paſt and done long ago, as yet obliging, if it were well conſidered: <hi>I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The Lords conducting and guiding of his people in this world, under a ſweet and orderly government, and honeſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in Church and State, working to others hands for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Gods honour and the good of a people, is a ſingular and obliging mercy, though the people enjoying it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a wilderneſſe; for, it aggravates their ingratitude, that he <hi>ſent before them Moſes,</hi> (who received Gods minde in Lawes, to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.7. who was ſingularly meek, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. and vehement in his affection to that people, <hi>Exodus</hi> 32.31, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>A third inſtance of mercy is taken from a particular paſſage of his goodneſſe in the wilderneſſe, turning <hi>Balaks</hi> intended curſe into a bleſſing, and cauſing <hi>Balaam</hi> againſt his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to bleſſe the people, and publiſh Gods good will toward them.

He gave them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories over <hi>Og</hi> and <hi>Sihon, Numb.</hi> 21. he brought them unto the promiſed land, and in <hi>Gilgal</hi> renewed the Covenant by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion

As the Lord hath the power of curſing and bleſſing in his own hand, however men be diſpoſed, ſo doth he turn intended curſes againſt his people into bleſſings, he can when he will protect them againſt the fraud as well as the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of enemies, yea, and make their very enemies befriend them; for, ſo much doth that hiſtory of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balak</hi> here point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at teach us. 4. The Lords ſparing mercies, his goodneſſe ſtriving with his peoples wickedneſſe, and his keeping and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of a Covenant when their ſins deſerve that it ſhould he broken, and his juſt judgements upon their violent and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enemies, ought to convince and engage his peoples hearts much to him; therefore ought they to remember for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, what had paſt <hi>from Shittim to Gilgal.</hi> 5. There are ſtanding monuments and experiences in the Church, which may abundantly ſatisfie them of the Lords truth, mercy and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in good will toward them, for their incouragement in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his way, and againſt every tentation they meet with therin, and for their conviction and clearing of the Lord, when it is otherwiſe; for, all theſe paſſages are rehearſed, that <hi>ye may know the righteouſneſſe of the Lord,</hi> or the manifold proofes of his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in keeping promiſe.</p>

                  <p>Having proved their ingratitude, the next fault challenged; is their hypocriticall formality; and therefore the Lord having cleared himſelf, and ſhewed what he had done, in the next place, the people are brought in for their part making great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of ſervice and duty to God, wherein they manifeſt nor one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their formality and affected ignorance, but their malicious hypocriſie alſo; for, whereas the Prophet ſpoke ſharply againſt them, they are brought in complaining that they were moſt willing to appeaſe Gods anger, and ready to offer him all kinde of ſervice, (yea, even what ſeems impoſſible, and is unlawfull) if it would pleaſe him, and yet he would never be pleaſed, but his Prophets ſtill cry out againſt them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The right way of worſhipping God, and of appeaſing his anger, hath been an old controverſie, and the truth thereof lighted on by few how clearly ſoever it be revealed: <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the LORD?</hi> (or <hi>prevent the face of the LORD,</hi> or, the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of his anger?) ſay they, as yet to learn. 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever convictions of ſin men may attain to, or whatever neceſſity they may ſee of being brought back to God by theſe conviction; (both which may be ſuppoſed here in heir profeſſion:) yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt men do heal theſe wounds ſlightly, placing all their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in external performance of ceremonies or religious duties, and neither fleeing to Chriſt, nor regarding the ſubſtantiall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of faith, repentance and new obediences for, <hi>ſhall I come before him with burnt offerings, &amp;c?</hi> is all they minde. 3. Men may have fair and broad profeſſions, and pretend much reverence to God, whoſe deeds do prove but ſtark naught; for, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>how before the high God,</hi> and yet give him no more but a ceremony. 4. Corrupt and unrenewed men had rather be at any pains, yea, even what is unpoſſible and ſinfully cruell, then follow Gods way, in fleeing to Chriſt quitting their own right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſneſſe, and ſtudying mortification of ſin; for, ſo are we taught by their offer of <hi>thouſands of rammes, and ten thouſands of rivers of oile</hi> (which could not be had in all the world) and their offer of their <hi>firſt-born</hi> to be ſlain in ſacrifices for ſin, as Jdolaters do, and all this rather then the killing of one luſt. 5. Externall performances of religion prove oft-times a great
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169976:82"/>ſnare to wicked men who uſe them, and a great obſtruction to the Miniſtery of the Word reproving ſin; for, this was their defence caſt in the Prophets teeth, that they were very obſervant of the Ceremoniall Law, and were ready to do more of that kinde, and therefore how could God be angry at them?</p>

                  <p>In oppoſition to their way, the Lord ſets down the true way of pleaſing him, and of their duty, containing the duties of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy whereunto they ſtood obliged each to other, and which hypocrites ordinarily neglect, and their duty of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion with God in humble and ſober walking before him in the exerciſe of Religion, and all theſe as a fruit of faith, fleeing to God through Chriſt in the Covenant, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ours. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However men be ignorant, or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, yet the way of pleaſing God is clearly revealed in his Word; for, in anſwer to their queſtion he replies, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man.</hi> 2. The Lords commands, (albeit they be the Lords injunctions to man, yet) are not rigid, or ſevere and unreaſonable, as hypocrites would alleadge, but gentle and deſirable; ſo is implied in that ſpeech, <hi>What doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to do juſtly, &amp;c?</hi> and in that they are called good. 3. The Lord requireth, eſpecially of men profeſſing Piety, that they make conſcience of juſtice and equity in their dealing each with other, that ſo they may prove the ſincerity of their profeſſion, and may adorn it; for, <hi>the Lord requires to do juſtly.</hi> 4. Beſides the duties which we owe to our neighbours in juſtice, there are other duties which we are alſo bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in humanity, or by the bond of Chriſtianity and charity; Theſe are here called <hi>mercie,</hi> which though no humane law can reach us, if we omit them, yet <hi>the Lord requires</hi> them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Chriſtianity doth call for them. 5. Though love be required in performing every commanded duty, yet for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of mercy, it is eſpecially requiſite, as that which bindes the duty upon us, and which muſt ſeaſon the duty when it is a doing: <hi>The Lord requires to love mercy.</hi> 6. No duties can ever be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably performed by an unrenewed perſon, or one who hath not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169976:82"/>by faith fled to God in the Covenant to be reconciled with him through Chriſt, that ſo his duties may be performed as fruits of ſaith, proving the ſincerity thereof, and ſtrength may come from God daily enabling him thereunto; Therefore alſo here God muſt be theirs by Covenant <hi>thy God.</hi> 7. A man reconciled to God by faith, ought not only to ſtudy to perform duties of the ſecond Table, but to joyn therewith a ſtudy of keeping communion with God in the exerciſes of true piety, by both which conjoyned and flowing from faith, he may prove himſelf to be ſomewhat more then either a moral civilian or an hypocrite attaines to, and alſo that he may not provoke God to puniſh his neglect of keeping communion with him by ſuffering him to fal into ſome ſin againſt the ſecond Table: Therefore alſo is required <hi>to walk with thy God.</hi> 8. In relation to God, humility and ſobriety is required in the performance of duties either of the firſt or ſecond Table; there is no conceit of righteouſneſſe or merit to be allowed in what we do, but when we have done all, we are to come humbly to finde grace by vertue of a free Covenant we are to debaſe our ſelves when we are before God in religious worſhip; we are in all ſobriety and humility to receive commands, take on imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and go about them with an humble dependance on him for conſtant ſupply of furniture: <hi>Walk humbly with thy God.</hi> 9. The people of God are to ſtudy conſtancy in their way, and eſpecially in humility, and for this end the bond of communion with God, and intereſt in him is to be kept faſt, and daily made uſe of; <hi>Walk humbly with God.</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169976:83"/>in the admonition, or in the rod. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Slighting of clearly revealed and commanded duties, will bring a rod upon a perſon or people; for, ſo doth the ſcope import. 2. The Lord doth not ſteal a judgement upon his people, but in great mercy forewarnes them of their danger, if they would make uſe of it; <hi>The Lords voice crieth,</hi> to give the alarm. 3. The teſtimonies of the Lords ſervants againſt ſin, and their warnings of wrath to come in their publike Miniſtery, is the Lords own warning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece to the rebellious; for, ſo is <hi>the Lords voice</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his voice in the mouth of his ſervants. 4. As Cities and eminent places have greateſt occaſions and incouragments to ſerve God, ſo when they come ſhort, their guilt is great, and they ſhare deepeſt in the cup of afflictions; therefore <hi>the Lords voice crieth unto the City,</hi> that is, to <hi>Jeruſalem, Samaria</hi> and other cities of the land, in which, as the Prophets preached moſt, ſo when the rod comes, they are alarmed eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as thoſe on whom it will light moſt ſadly. 5. We ought to be ſenſible of afflictions ſent upon us, as Gods Meſſengers ſent with a Meſſage to us, and the Lord will cauſe the moſt ſtubborn to feel his hand in them; for, this <hi>Hear the rod,</hi> is not only an exhortation to take the alarm, and be ſenſible of the rod when it comes; but a prediction, that though they would not heare the Prophets, yet they ſhould both heare and feel this Meſſenger. See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.15, 16.6. We ought not onely to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the ſmart of the rod when it comes, but chiefly to look to the hand of God in it, and to what he would teach by it; <hi>Hear the rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> 7. It is an evidence of the fear of God to take warning of a rods coming, or to get Gods minde in the rod ſeen, and to be affected with it and obey it, and onely fearers of God get this uſe of it; <hi>The man of wiſdome ſhall ſee thy Name,</hi> that is, take up thy authority in theſe warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the Word, and diſcern what thou manifeſteſt of thy minde by the rod. 8. They onely are wiſe indeed, who fear God, and who learn to make uſe of his Word and Providences toward them; for, he who feares God is called, <hi>the man of wiſdome,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtantiall wiſdome,</hi> that hath a being, as the word ſignifieth, all other wiſdome being but empty and vain.</p>

                  <p>To help them to underſtand his minde in the rod, the Lord enters upon a more ſpeciall accuſation of them for the ſins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the ſame; here he ſets before them their violation of juſtice and mercy, and charges upon them that by wicked meanes they had gathered great treaſure, which proved them to be wicked who did thus enrich themſelves. The meanes whereby they made this purchaſe, (or at leaſt endeavoured it) and for which they are challenged, are, 1. <hi>Scant meaſures,</hi> or <hi>lean</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſtarving the buyers. 2. Inexcuſable deceit in the matter of <hi>weights,</hi> and <hi>balances,</hi> bringing in more gain to them then was right. 3. Cruel violence uſed toward the poor. 4. Fraud and circumventing of one another, which was univerſall among them. All theſe accuſations the Lord referreth to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to beare witneſſe of the truth of them, and poſeth their own conſcience, if notwithſtanding their profeſſions by externall ſacrificing, the Lord could in juſtice acquit them, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abhor, and condemn and plague them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord abhoreth thoſe ſins eſpecially which are commited after many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, &amp; by ſuch as profeſſe much piety: <hi>Are there treaſures of wickedneſſe &amp;c?</hi> ſaith he and that after ſo many admonitions and threatenings of the rod, and notwithſtanding your great Profeſſion. 2. It is a great ſigne of unſoundneſſe, when ſuch as are eminent in practiſing externall duties of the firſt table, can without ſcruple commit wickedneſſe againſt the ſecond; for, ſaith he, <hi>Are there yet</hi> (after the great offers of ſacrifices, is there yet ſo much unrenewedneſſe as to gather up) <hi>treaſures of wickedneſſe?</hi> 3. Exceſſive love unto, and deſire after riches driving men to uſe unlawfull meanes of purchaſe, is a ſure mark of wickedneſſe, let the purchaſer pretend to what he will, and of Gods diſpleaſure, however in his Providence he may permit ſuch to proſper; for, they are <hi>treaſures of wickedneſſe in the houſes of the wicked,</hi> and for this the Lord challengeth. 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe in weights, balances and meaſures is a ſinfull means of purchaſing riches, and a clear inſtance of injuſtice, which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169976:84"/>is abominable in the ſight of God; for, ſo much do the words hold forth. 5. Even our ſelves ſeriouſly conſidering our caſe, may not onely ſee the truth of what the Word challengeth, but may eaſily judge, that God will not paſſe by approved groſſe guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor juſtifie the doers thereof, whatever mask of profeſſion they cover it withall; therefore the Lord appeales to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both for the truth of the fact, <hi>Are there yet treaſures, &amp;c?</hi> and for the demerit of it, <hi>ſhall I count them pure with the wicked balances, &amp;c?</hi> or, <hi>purifie,</hi> and declare them juſt? 6. Men ought not to dallie and ſooth up themſelves in a dream of Gods approbation of them in their ſinfull wayes; Therefore he puts them to it, to judge righteous judgement in this particular, <hi>ſhall I count them pune &amp;c?</hi> 7. However men ſtudy to blinde or put to ſilence their own conſciences, that ſo they may ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſtation; yet in the day of Gods controverſie it will be mens ſoreſt adverſarie, and plead Gods quarrel moſt thoroughly. Therefore he leaves this challenge at the dore of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as that which in due time would ſpeak out an anſwer to that queſtion, <hi>ſhall I count them pure?</hi> 8. It is a great ſigne of wickedneſſe in any perſon to imploy the power God hath given them above others, to wicked ends; <hi>for the rich men thereof</hi> (that is of the City, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. or of the land) <hi>are full of violence;</hi> Becauſe they are rich, therefore they are violent and beare it out. 9. Violent oppreſſion and deceitfull circumvention are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſins in Gods eſtimation, as tending both to one end, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riches with wronging of others; and flowing from the ſame fountain, being onely fitted for diverſe times, and according to the diverſe conditions of the wicked; for, if they be powerfull they are violent; and if not, they ſupply that defect by deceit; Therefore is it joyned with the other, <hi>the inhabitants thereof</hi> (or, all ranks almoſt of the land) <hi>have ſpaken lies, and their tongue is deceitfull in their mouths,</hi> that is, as oft as they ſpeak they bring out fraud and deceit.</p>

                  <p>Followeth a particular enumeration of theſe judgements whereby he would make them ſick and deſolate; The firſt ſtroak is famine, flowing not from ſcarcity of proviſion, but from the Lords withdrawing of a Bleſſing, <hi>Lev</hi> 26.26. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.10, <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Threatenings giving out of old againſt ſin, ſtand in force againſt the ſame ſins in all generations; for the threatenings of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> are declared to be in force in <hi>Michas</hi> dayes. 2. God hath ſo immediate an hand in feeding men by the creatures, that when he withdraweth his bleſſing,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169976:85"/>the creatures, though given in never ſo great abundance, will not feed; for, <hi>thou ſhalt eat, and not be ſatisfied.</hi> 3. It is juſt with God to let ſuch as provoke him in gathering together out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, know how far they wrong themſelves, while they do it on the creature, forgetting the Creator; Therefore againſt ſuch as provoked him by gathering of wealth, he threatens that all of it ſhould not ſo much as keep them from ſtarving. The ſecond ſtroak is, <hi>their caſting down to be in the midſt of them;</hi> that is, they ſhall be exhauſted in their own land, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine evils, although they were ſecure of forreign enemies, or of captivity by them; Teaching, that as inſtine troubles are a fore judgement and ſharp puniſhment for ſin: ſo the Lord can reach a perſon or people in the midſt of all their contentments, and can abaſe them as low by his ſecret curſe, as by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemy; <hi>thy caſting down ſhall be in the midſt of thee.</hi> The third ſtroak is, that there ſhall be no poſſibility of exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his plagues, when they ſhall eſſay all meanes to preſerve what is precious to them, as wives, children, treaſures, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> it ſhall be to no purpoſe; for what eſcapes at one time, ſhall be cut off at another. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Humane endeavours will not exempt men from divine judgements purſuing them for ſin, <hi>thou ſhalt take hold,</hi> to wit, that thou mayeſt hold faſt, or pull out of danger, <hi>but ſhalt not deliver.</hi> 2. When wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners are preſerved from one ſtroak, it is onely that they may be reſerved for a greater; for, <hi>what thou delivereſt will I give up to the ſword.</hi> The fourth ſtroak threatened is, their being deprived of laboured-for comforts, the land being given as a prey to their enemies, who ſhould devour their proviſion, as they had bereft others of the fruit of their labours, ſo ſhould the enemy, or other inſtruments of Gods wrath deal with them, they ſhould not reap (much leſſe eat) of what they had ſowed, they ſhould not as in times of joy anoint themſelves with the oile they had trodden out, nor drink of their own wine. See the like threatenings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.38, 39, 40. <hi>Amos.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 11, 13. and the contrary promiſes, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 62.8, 9. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Sin provoketh the Lord (however he be long-ſuffering and ſlow to execute) to make mans endeavours for his own ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be vaine, whereof he will give proof when the cup of iniquity is full: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſowe, but thou ſhalt not reap, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Lord doth ſo in deep wiſdome contrive the way of his judgements, as they may give the ſoreſt daſh to the wicked, and may repay their ſin; Therefore as they by oppreſſion and deceit.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169976:85"/>reaped where they ſowed not: ſo now he will make them <hi>ſowe, and not reap;</hi> yea, he lets them <hi>ſowe, and tread the olives and ſweet wine,</hi> that having employed their paines, and being filled with expectation, their diſappointment may be the greater.</p>

                  <p>Here we have another cauſe of Gods rod, and a further accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for their idolatry, which being ſet up by <hi>Omri</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> his ſon, (who beſide the golden calves worſhipped <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.25, 30, 31, 32.) was followed by the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and by <hi>Judah</hi> alſo, by reaſon of the affinity that was betwixt the two Kings at that time, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.18. for which ſin, whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences they held out, the Lord threatens them yet further with extreme deſolation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Idolatry and corruption of true Religion and the worſhip of God is the great cauſe of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with his viſible Church: <hi>for the ſtatutes of Omri are beot.</hi> 2. The Authors and Promoters of idolatry in the viſible Church, are marked and obſerved by the Lord; as <hi>Omri</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> are. 3. No injunctions of rulers, nor concurrence of publick authority can make idolatry lawful, nor juſtifie thoſe who walk in ſuch wayes, being enjoyned; for, it is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, <hi>the ſtatutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the houſe of Ahab.</hi> 4. No example of multitudes nor ſhewes of prudence, can juſtifie idolatry, or perverting of truth; <hi>The works of the houſe of Ahab are kept, and ye</hi> (both <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>) <hi>walk in their counſels.</hi> They thought it a prudential way, by conformity with the heathen to keep peace with them, and be free of the ſcorn of the wiſe of the world, becauſe of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Religion; but all this excuſeth not. 5. Whatever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage men expect by corrupting of Religion, yet the nature of their work tends to a contrary end, and doth draw on all thoſe evils, which they by ſinning ſtudy to decline; for, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretences they had, yet, <hi>ye walk,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, that I ſhould make thee a deſolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hiſſing,</hi> it expoſed them both to ſpoile and reproach
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169976:86"/>which they ſought to ſhun. 6 Idolatry is a land-deſtroying ſin, and makes a people extremely deſolate and contemptible, ſo much alſo doth this threatening teach, wherin there are ſadder things threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened then for their ſins againſt the ſecond Table: <hi>I will make thee a deſolation, and the inhabitants an hiſſing, &amp;c.</hi> 7. As the Lords people have their peculiar priviledges, ſo alſo their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>reproach,</hi> or puniſhment proportionable to their profaning of that great priviledge of his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.20, 23. and that becauſe ſin in them, who boaſt themſelves to be the people of God, is ſingularly great; <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye ſhall bear the reproach of my people.</hi>

The truly godly are very precious and uſeful in the viſible Church, as being not only reſtreſhful to other godly men, but inſtruments and means of bringing down bleſſings, by dealing with God in prayer by ſtanding in the breach, &amp;c.

                  <p>For further confirmation of this univerſal defection, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth it in ſeveral ranks: The firſt inſtance is in the perſon of great ones, who being bent on evil, ſuch of them as are in authority, as Princes of the blood, and delegate Judges do avow bribery; and they whoſe requeſts are commands; do ask for gifts, and expoſe juſtice to ſale: and ſo, ſuch others in the land as are great and can give money, fear not to communicate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with the Judge, to defraud and oppreſs the poor; and the Judge and the rich man conſpire to perfect what they have agreed upon. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Great men are ordinarily firſt and moſt eminent in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and general defections; therefore they are here firſt ſpoken to. 2. The Lord eſpecially marketh and abhorreth mens eager diſpoſition to do evil; whereas he is tender toward ſuch as through tentation and infirmity do ſlip; for, ſaith he, <hi>that they may do evil with both hands earneſtly, the Prince asketh, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Albeit it be a ſin in Judges to receive bribes never ſo privately, yet it doth much aggravate the ſin if it be publickly avowed: <hi>the Prince asketh, and the Judge asketh for a reward.</hi> 4. Sins are moſt dangerous, when they appear vailed under the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or committed under the ſpecious pretence of equity; for, ſo was it in this time of defection, Bribery went under the name of <hi>reward,</hi> or retribution for their ſervice and favour ſhewed. 5. It is a great iniquity when men in authority do not bear down wicked great men, but they have encouragement to do wrong, and may get their will accompliſhed with Judges, by reaſon of their greatneſſe and wealth; for, ſo is complained of in this time of defection, <hi>the great man he uttereth his miſchievous device,</hi> he dares utter it to the Judge for concurrence, and gets it put in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169976:87"/>execution on the poor. 6. It is an uſual ſin alſo, in declining times for great men ſo to play to others hands, as to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and one another in evil courſes; for ſo was it in this time: <hi>ſo they wrap,</hi> or, <hi>twiſt it up:</hi> a ſimilitude taken from cords twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together to make them ſtrong, ſignifying the conſpiracy of the Judge and great man, that the one may get his bribe, and the other may make his prey of the poor.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond inſtance of this defection, is in the perſons of ſuch, eſpecially great ones, as ſeemed to be better then others: the beſt and moſt ſtreight of which were both hurtful and catching, as thornes are: unto this he ſubjoynes a threatening, ſhewing that it portended the near approaching of the judgements foretold by the Prophets, wherein as they had formerly intangled others with their thorny griping covetouſneſſe, and ſtrengthened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as twiſted cords in their wicked wayes; ſo now themſelves ſhould be ſo perplexed as they ſhould not know whither to turn them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In times of defection there may be ſome ready to ſhelter themſelves under this pretext, that they are not ſo evil nor ſo unjuſt as others; therefore a word muſt be directed in particular to <hi>the beſt and moſt upright,</hi> to let them ſee the vanity of that pretext. 2. No goodneſſe or uprightneſſe in men is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cover their declining after the ſins of the time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Prophet ſpeak even againſt <hi>the beſt and moſt upright.</hi> 3. Even men who ſeem to be well-affected and better then others, are in hazard to be drawn away with the evils of the time; for, ſo were they in <hi>Micahs</hi> dayes, with covetouſneſſe and oppreſſion, which were the ſins of that time: <hi>The beſt of them is as a briar, &amp;c.</hi> 4. It is an evident ſymptome of a declining time, when men become covetous, oppreſſors, catching, and dangerous to meddle withal; therefore are the decliners here obſerved to be <hi>briars, and ſharper then a thorne-hedge.</hi> Covetouſneſſe is the ordinary evil into which backſliders fall, and the ordinary fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of judgments, for then the world becomes an idol, and ſo is fitted for Gods ſtroak. 5. However the Lord may bear long with the filthy their being filthy ſtill, providing the righteous be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

It addes much to the weight of a rod, that the Lord hath forewarned ſinners of their danger, and yet they have not taken warning; therefore is their affliction cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the day of thy watchmen,</hi> that is, not ſo much a day of vengeance on their falſe Prophers and wicked Governours, as the day which the true Prophets foretold them would come, unleſſe they repem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 7. The Lord in the diſpenſation of his Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men hath an eſpecial regard to his own Word carried by his ſervants, that the truth and certainty thereof may be ſeene; therefore alſo is their ſtroak called <hi>the day of thy watchmen,</hi> that they might take notice that what his ſervants ſpake was certain. 3. Gods Miniſters ought carefully to ſtudy the condition of his people, and labour to ſtand in Gods counſel, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his minde concerning the Church, and faithfully give warning thereof; therefore are they called <hi>watchmen,</hi> by a name borrowed from the practice of Centinels in armies or cities. 9. Albeit men in their wicked wayes dream that they ought not to be accountable unto any, yet the Lord will take inſpection of their wayes, and call them to an account for them; <hi>thy viſitation cometh.</hi> 10. The Lord will ſo purſue guiltineſſe with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the guilty man ſhall be entangled, and have no way to ſhift the rod; and guiltineſſe in a time of need will reduce men to ſuch ſtraits and perplexities, ſuch anxieties and preſſures of minde, that they ſhall not know whither to turn them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, <hi>now ſhall be their perplexity,</hi> or <hi>intangling;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to the righteous even in darkneſſe, there ariſeth light of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and comfort.</p>

In declining and ſad times, the people of God ought to be moſt earneſt in dealing with him, depending on him, and in expecting his help; for, the word ſignifieth that like a watchman ſet upon a tower, he will intently obſerve and watch, <hi>and look to God,</hi> and for help from him.

In the reeling and turning upſide-down of things here below, the people of God are not ſo much to look to theſe incertainties, as unto the immutability of God in what he is to his people; for, ſo much alſo is implied in his <hi>looking to the Lord.</hi> 5. With our faith and ardency in expecting Gods help, patient waiting is alſo to be conjoyned, by keeping his way, notwithſtanding difficulties or delayes of deliverance, and reſolving to have faith exerciſed before it get the victory, therefore doth he reſolve alſo <hi>to wait for God.</hi> 6. In all the people of Gods waiting on him there is ſtill hope and confidence, though it be not always ſeen to the waiter; for, the ſame word in the Originall ſignifies both <hi>waiting</hi> and <hi>hoping.</hi> 7. As it is the Lord onely who can ſave and deliver, and as he is the onely Saviour of his Church by vertue of the Covenant of grace made with her in Chriſt; ſo will he ſave all ſuch as will implore him onely in their ſtraits, and have all their ſalvation from him, and in him according to the Covenant; for, all this doth that ſtile, <hi>the God of my ſalvation,</hi> which is made the ground of his waiting, implie. 8. We ought to encourage our ſelves to deal with God, by acting faith, that we ſhall be accepted, <hi>I will look and wait,</hi> ſaith he, and that becauſe, <hi>my God will hear me.</hi> 9. God is bound by Covenant to hear the lawful and needy deſires of his people in due time; <hi>my God will hear me.</hi> 10. Gods hearing of our prayers, or confidence that he will hear them, is ſufficient encouragement in hardeſt times; for ſuch is the Prophets encouragement here, <hi>my God will hear me;</hi> A man that gets acceſſe unto God, and knows he will ſpeed in heaven, may defie time to ſtraiten him, having ſuch a fair back door of enlargement.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet proceeds to hold out more ſpecial grounds of conſolation and encouragement; the firſt whereof is, that the Church hath ground of hope of a ſatisfactory deliverance, and in this verſe the Prophet ſpeaking in her perſon, directs her how to manage this hope of comfort, in reference to her inſulting enemies, to wit, that having ſuch ground of hope, ſhe ſhould reſolutely profeſſe the ſame before them, and contemn their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent mockery, and reſolutely endure it, till the Lord by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al deliverance put them to ſilence. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Church of God may for ſin be deprived of the poſſeſſion of her dignities, and be caſt into a perplexed deſolate condition, wanting both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and judgement to know what to do: for, ſhe may <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>ſit in darkneſſe.</hi> 2. The people of God being in trouble will not want enemies to reproach and inſult over them, to embitter their calamity; for, here they have <hi>an enemy rejoycing againſt them.</hi> 3. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee the Church brought very low, and yet be raiſed up again, to ſee her fall is not to ruine, and her eclipſes not continuing; therefore doth ſhe expect to <hi>ariſe</hi> after her <hi>fall,</hi> and to have <hi>light</hi> after her <hi>darkneſſe: When I fall, I ſhall ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> whereas the fall of enemies hath no ſuch comfort. 4. The Lord is alſufficient to give unto his people comfort in trouble, and an iſſue from it, therefore doth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Church ſeek no other ground for her faith: but, <hi>the Lord ſhall be a light unto me;</hi> it being he who had undertaken, and who by manifeſting his own preſence could create comfort and iſſue in the midſt of troubles. 5. When the Churches pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and grounds of hope are rightly ſeen, neither will ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be found to have ſuch cauſe of boaſting, becauſe of her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as they ſuppoſe, nor needs the Church be much affected with their inſulting, but may profeſſe her deſpiſing them and it both, in hope of his help; therefore ſaith ſhe, <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemy;</hi> as if ſhe ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However enemies having preſent advantage againſt the Church, will not give over their inſolent reproaching, which ſhe muſt endure in hope: yet the Lord by delivering her will put them to ſilence, and let them ſee that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169976:90"/>their joy was groundleſſe: <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, when I fall, I ſhall arife, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Church is yet further directed how to manage this her hope of comfort, in relation to her guilt, which might ſeeme to ſtand in the way of it: for, whereas it might be objected, How could ſhe expect that God would be her light, ſeeing ſhe by ſin had provoked him to anger, and to caſt her into theſe troubles, and ſo was her party? She anſwers, that ſhe ſubmiſſively ſtooping, and accepting in theſe troubles the puniſhment of her iniquity out of his hand, did expect that in due time, the Lord, whom ſhe had provoked to afflict her, would plead her cauſe againſt her enemies who unjuſtly oppreſſed her, and plague them: and would reſtore her to her ancient glory, and in publick view give her to enjoy the effects of his bounty and fidelity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord may have fatherly indignation againſt his people for their ſins, and may teſtifie the ſame by inflicting of outward calamities, and yet not reject their perſons; for this cauſe is the godlies trouble called here, <hi>the indignation of the Lord,</hi> though men were inſtruments. See, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2. 2. It is the duty of the godly, when God is angry and chaſtiſeth, to be ſenſible of their ſin procuring the ſame, to ſtoop humbly under his afflicting hand, and to bear it patiently and ſubmiſſively, accepting the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity: <hi>I will bar the indiguation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> ſaith ſhe. 3.

The Church endeavouring to comfort her ſelf with hope in God in her troubles, will abundantly be confirmed therein by God:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169976:91"/>for after her profeſſed hope, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. the Lord confirmes her here by a promiſe. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. 2. The Church may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by her ſins that the Lord ſhould lay her deſolate, expoſed to the fury of enemies, without all government, protection, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent being, and he may for a ſeaſon in juſtice ſo deal with her: lor, <hi>her walls were to be built,</hi> and conſequently were ruined, not only as a vineyard with the hedge pulled down, but a city totally deſolate. 3. The Lord will in due time reſtore and make up the ruines of his deſtroyed Church and people: for, <hi>thy walls are to be built.</hi> 4. Gods time is to be patiently waited upon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of his Church; for, there is <hi>the day</hi> for doing it, which he will keep, and no ſooner. 5. As it is one of the Churches great trials to lie under the power of oppreſſing tyrants and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who by their decrees and injunctions executed with rigour, do labour to ruine her, and bear down the work of God: So the Lord when he hath wrought his work upon his Church by ſuch a trial will deliver them alſo from that yoke, and ſet them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſerve him, and enjoy tranquillity without ſuch interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions: for, <hi>in that day the decree ſhall be far removed.</hi> This the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſome taſte of at their return from <hi>Babylon:</hi> and at ſome times thereafter, but it ſhall be more accompliſhed at their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord, when there ſhall be no more decrees of captivity to follow. 6. All ſorts of perſons of all Nations have free acceſſe unto the Church under the Goſpel, and the Lord hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to make them come: for, <hi>in that alſo he ſhall come even to thee from Aſſyria, and from the fortified city, and from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe even to the rive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The priviledges and advantages of the Church of God being rightly ſeen, may and will prevail even with her greateſt enemies, and with ſuch as have their own good accommodations, to lay down their enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and renounce all, and come and ſhare with her; for, <hi>he ſhall come to thee from Aſſyria,</hi> her moſt inveterate enemy, <hi>and from the fortified cities, and from the fortreſſe</hi> by which <hi>Egypt</hi> ſeems to be ſignified, which was well fortified by Nature and Art, and the Hebrew word here hath affinity with the Hebrew name of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and withal <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> are ordinarily joyned in ſuch promiſes, <hi>Iſa</hi> 19.23, 24, 25. 9 The Lords meanes for gathering and enlarging of his Church, is the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Goſpel, whereby he leads all captive unto the obedience of Chriſt; for, ſo much doth the other interpretation of <hi>the decree</hi> teach us, <hi>the decree ſhall be far removed,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall come, &amp;c.</hi> Where the Goſpel may be called <hi>a decree,</hi> as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods eternal Purpoſe and Ordinance concerning the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners publiſhed in his Name to the world, for ſinners to lay hold upon, and the efficacy thereof depending upon Gods counſel and decree. 10. The publiſhing and prevailing of the Goſpel through the world, notwithſtanding all impediments and oppoſition, is a work wherein the hand and power of God is to be ſeen for what is already done, and to be reſted upon for what is to be accompliſhed; for it is he only who can undertake, that <hi>the decree ſhall be far removed.</hi>

Chriſt is the only Shepherd, to whoſe care the Church is concredited, and who will have a ſpecial care of them in trouble; for to him doth the Prophet pray, <hi>Feed thy people which dwell ſolitarily.</hi> 4. Chriſt doth not only feed his people, but doth exerciſe a juriſdiction over them, whereby he keeps them in ſubjection to him, drives them to their food, and expels noxious humours, which may hinder their feeding and thriving; and he doth alſo by his power protect them whom he thus feedeth and governeth: all which are deſirable, and to be prayed for from him: <hi>Feed thy people with thy rod.</hi> See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. 5. Chriſt hath many relations to, and intereſts in his Church, not broken off by any trouble, to endear her to his affection and care, and which may encourage faith to go to him in need; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Feed thy people, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell ſolitarily, &amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding their deſolate condition, they are his peculiar portion, wherein he hath not a temporary, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal right, as men have to their <hi>heritage</hi> in all generations: and accordingly he will care for and poſſeſſe them, and this Charter and Priviledge ſtands faſt to the Church of the Jewes here prayed for, to be manifeſted after all their diſperſions. 6. Chriſt hath ample allowance to beſtow upon his people, and all fulneſſe for faith to lay hold upon in prayer, for the ſupply of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very need; for, he can make them <hi>ferd in Baſhan and Gilead,</hi> which were fruitful paſtures for flocks; though in relation to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> this may be underſtood more particularly of reſtoring them to their own fruitful land, to enjoy it in its full extent, even to <hi>Baſhan</hi> and <hi>Gilead,</hi> which lay far off beyond <hi>Jordan.</hi> See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.19. 7. The Church of God hath rich experiences of his former goodneſſe, to encourage her in her preſent ſuits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of faith ought to make uſe; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Let them feed as in the dayes of old.</hi> 8. Chriſt will not deny the needy and lawful deſires of his people, particularly ſuch as flow from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-mindedneſſe, and are put up for the Church; but will take
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169976:93"/>charge of his afflicted people, to give them a bleſſed iſſue; for, the requeſt is here granted. 9. As Chriſt is Omnipotent, ſo he will do wonders, if need requires, for the behoof of his people, and he takes pleaſure to convey the expreſſions of his love to them, and to bring about their deliverance to their own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers admiration; for, <hi>I will ſhew him</hi> (or make him to enjoy) <hi>marvellous things.</hi> 10. As Chriſts manifeſting of himſelf in former times for his people, engageth him to do yet more for them; ſo will he make good whatever they have ground from former experience to expect; for, <hi>According to the dayes of thy coming out of the land of Egypt, I will ſhew him marvellows things;</hi> where faith is not only to feed upon the great acts he did; but alſo upon the way of his doing of them, his paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their iniquities, their murmurings and unbelief, his redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to ſtraits before he appeared for them, his working by ſmall, unlikely and contrary means, &amp;c. 11. The Lord ſtands enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to his ancient people, to give them a deliverance from their troubles and bondage, as great and wonderful as that from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> was; for, ſo is expreſſely promiſed: and albeit this be ſpiritually accompliſhed, and daily accompliſhing in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titual deliverances of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, yet this promiſe is made chiefly to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in relation to their deſolation; and albeit ſome pledge of this was given at their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet then it came ſhort among other things of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> in that it was not National, even of the Jewes; and therefore it ſeems to have relation to the time of the reſtitution and ſaving of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which will be ſo great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as will in a ſort obſcure former mercies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.14, 15.</p>

Men without God, and not walking in his way are eaſily confounded when the Lord turneth his hand againſt them, and to do for his people; for, they who no doubt were inſolent and proud before, <hi>ſhall lay their hand upon their mouth, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Gods wonderful works of providence in behalf of his people, and againſt their enemies, do ordinarily produce but vaniſhing and empty fruits in the world, and amongſt enemies, as either to confound and aſtoniſh them, as if they were dumb and deaf, when what God hath done for his people is mentioned; <hi>They ſhall be confounded, they ſhall lay their hand on their mouth, their cares ſhall be deafe.</hi> Or, if they work any more, it is but pretended ſubjection, and friendſhip out of feare: <hi>They ſhall lick the duſt like a ſerpent, they ſhall move out of their holes, &amp;c.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169976:94"/>the Word hath not place, and where mens miſery and Gods mercy are not diſcovered to them. 6. It is a great proof of Gods power, and metter of encouragement to the Church, to ſee their enemies brought ſo low, as to yield, if it were but feigned obedience, and pretend friendſhip, as is uſual in the time of the Churches proſperity; for, it is an encouragement; <hi>That they ſhall lick the duſt like a Serpent, &amp;c.</hi> We are to be ſenſible and warie of the falſhood of ſome, who pretend to ſerye Chriſt, and to be friends to his Church, as withal to adore the Power of God, making them to ſtoop ſo far, as to <hi>lie,</hi> as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3. in the original. 7.

Gods matchleſneſſe appears to his people, and doth affect their hearts, not ſo much in acts of his power abſolutely conſidered, (though they ought to be ſenſible of theſe alſo,) as in his acts of grace, and his being great in his Chriſt pardoning ſin; yea, when great things are done or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them, they wonder not ſo much at theſe, as that his mercy ſhould come over their tranſgreſſions, to make way for theſe great things. Therefore they declare there is no God like him, <hi>who pardoneth iniquity;</hi> and when they heare of all the former encouragements, they admire this above them all, that their ſin had not ſtood in the way of theſe mercies, and that becauſe the godly are ſenſible of the deſert of ſin, and of their inability to ſatisfie juſtice for it, and therefore pardon is ſweet above all to them. 4. Outward mercies were they never ſo great and full, will never yield true ſatisfaction, unleſſe they be joyned with reconcillation with God, and pardon of ſin, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are we taught here, all the former encouragements do refreſh, when they may alſo admire and rejoyce in God, <hi>who pardoneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity.</hi> 5. God by a free pardon, will for his Chriſts ſake lift off and take away the burden of the guilt of ſin, were it never ſo great, from off his wearied people, who flee to him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and ſo eaſe them of it, and give them ground of quietneſſe in their conſcience: for, ſo doth the word in the Original ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>pardoning</hi> import, and it is extended even to <hi>iniquity and tranſgreſſion,</hi> and this is the only way to get true eaſe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſin. 6. The ſelf-condemned ſinner in looking for pardon from God, ought to look upon him as ſingular, and not meaſure his condeſcendence or mercy by their thoughts, or by any other mould, but expect that as he is matchleſſe, ſo is his mercy, pity and love; for, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?</hi> doth teach us ſo much: and this is to be taken along with every expreſſion of pardon, that he is match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that doth that, and doth it matchleſly.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond expreſſion is, <hi>He retaineth not his anger for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delights in mercy;</hi> wherein his great mercy, and his taking pleaſure in it, in pardoning ſin, is amplified and commended from his putting off juſtly conceived diſpleaſure againſt ſin and the ſinner. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord will put on juſt anger againſt the ſins of his people, and may poſſibly not paſſe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at all times, but may teſtifie his diſpleaſure by effects againſt them, whom he will yet pardon; for, it is here ſuppoſed that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169976:96"/>he may have <hi>anger,</hi> and let it out for a time. 2. The Lord when he is provoked, and teſtifying his diſpleaſure, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be reconciled: for, <hi>he retaines not his anger;</hi> or, as the word ſignifieth, holds it not with a ſtrong hand, but ſeeketh when he is angry, that we ſhould ſtand in the gap, and intreat him to paſſe from it. 3. It highly commendeth God; and is matter of great conſolation to us, that his anger againſt his people is not everlaſting; That <hi>he retains not his anger for ever,</hi> is a mercy, however it may endure for a long tract of time. 4. Gods mercy is the only cauſe wherefore he doth not purſue his controverſies againſt his people with eternal wrath, and this is to be ſeen and acknowledged by all them who are ſo graciouſly dealt with; for, ſo do they here, <hi>He retaineth not his anger for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.</hi> 5. Albeit God, bleſſed over all, delight in himſelf and all his attributes, and in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of them in the world, yet after the manner of men, he is ſaid <hi>to delight in mercy,</hi> in regard that attribute is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the world, in his bounty to all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5. in his not taking pleaſure in the death, even of reprobates, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.32. albeit that for the manifeſtation of his juſtice he willeth it; and in that to his own people juſtice is his ſtrange act, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21. and mercy his ordinary way of dealing, and all the mercy he ſheweth them he doth it not grudgingly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. nor doth he delight to be at odds with them, but alwayes to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in his love, and therefore his mercy ends many a plea, that it may make way, and burſt through clouds to manifeſt it ſelfe.</p>

                     </gap> will yet again have compaſſion, as the Hebrew way of ſpeech
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169976:96"/>is often taken and tranſlated. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Many of our conceptions and expreſſions will not be able to take up, or utter the great goodneſſe of God in pardoning ſin, nor the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a ſelf-condemned ſinner ſeeth in it, nor the great benefit he reaps by it; therefore are expreſſions ſo multiplied about it. 2. Albeit it be a ſweet ſigne of a pardoned man, when he eſteems of a pardon, and of God as a pardoner, and when he loveth God, becauſe he will forgive his own people; yet it addes much to the aſſurance and comfort of this benefit, when every ſelf-condemned ſinner layeth hold on this benefit, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to himſelfe, which ſhould be endeavoured, and may be attained; for, here the Church cometh to application: <hi>He will have compaſſion upon us.</hi> 3. God is provoked by his peoples ſins to turn away from them, and to ſeem to neglect them, their prayers and conditions; ſo much is imported, in that he is to <hi>turn again</hi> to them. 4. Upon the Lords pardoning of ſinne, not only is anger taken away, (as <hi>v.</hi> 18.) but reconciliation, and the ſhining of his favourable countenance will follow in due time; for, <hi>He will turn again and have compaſſion.</hi> 5. Albeit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours formerly received, and abuſed by us, may be a great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to our faith in expecting favour, when we need it again, yet the Lord in mercy will again and again be kinde to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for, ſo doth the other interpretation teach: <hi>He will again have compaſſion.</hi> See, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10 11, 12, 13, 14. with 16. 6. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the guilty childe of God, having abuſed former mercies, and lying in his ſinne and miſery, be an unworthy and contemptible object, having nothing wherewith to commend himſelfe to God; yet pity in God will condeſcend to look upon him, and bring an argument from his very miſery to help him; for, <hi>He will have compaſſion upon us,</hi> ſay they. 7. The Lord is ſo far from rejecting his people for their unworthineſſe and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he will keep them in ſuch a needy condition, as may make them fit objects of his pity; for, in that <hi>He will have compaſſion,</hi> it implieth, that he will keep them in ſuch a needy condition as needs compaſſion. The Church needs not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be freed altogether of the badges of her miſery, unleſſe ſhe would baniſh his tender compaſſions out of the world 8. The Lords needy and diſtreſſed people, will get a room in his tender affection, till they be helped, and compaſſion ſhall carve out their ſupply and iſſue; for, ſo much alſo doth his <hi>having compaſſion</hi> teach us.</p>
                  <p>Another expreſſion clearing this benefit, is, <hi>He will ſubdue
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169976:97"/>our iniquities;</hi> which may be taken up, either as a further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the way of pardon, that God overcomes the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of ſinne, ſtanding in his mercies way, or as an effect of pardon, that God not only pardons the guilt, but mortifieth the power of ſinne in his people. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſinne in none, but ſuch as he makes ſenſible of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of ſinne, and makes them to ſee it as an army, ſtanding in mercies way, <hi>to be ſubdued;</hi> for, ſo do they expreſſe the way of pardon. 2. Gods mercy is alſufficient to overcome all provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to overcome the ill deſerving of ſinne; for, <hi>He will ſubdue iniquity.</hi> See, <hi>Cant</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.20. 3. Whoever get pardon of ſinne, they alſo fall in love with, and ſee the need of mortification of ſin, this the other interpretation of <hi>ſubduing</hi> teacheth. The pardoned Church accounteth God ſingular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he will ſubdue iniquity.</hi> 4. Mortification of ſinne is to be wrought by God, and expected from him, otherwiſe our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will not prevaile, and when our endeavours of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication availe not, yet our caſe is not hopeleſſe; for, <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt expreſſion, <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea,</hi> containes a further effect of pardon, that ſins once par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, ſhall not be remembred nor laid to their charge againe, which is held out in a borrowed ſpeech taken from amongſt men; that being without poſſibility of being recovered by men, which is caſt into the bottom of the ſea, and that where it is deepeſt. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit a pardoned ſinner, when he commits new ſin, or is not humble, tender or thankful under the ſenſe of pardon, may have former ſinnes brought to remembrance, to be matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and ſtirring up to repentance; and albeit an houre of tentation may ſhake looſe all evidences of pardon, yet ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once pardoned, the remiſſion ſtands never to be repeated, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new confirmations are ſtill to be ſought after, nor will the pardoned ſinne come in account againſt the pardoned man before God again; for, ſo much doth this borrowed ſpeech teach. See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. 2. Gods mercy is ſo infinite, that multitudes of ſin in the ſelf-judging ſinner, will not hinder his free and full pardon, nor needs to obſtruct to peaceable effects thereof in the conſcience of the pardoned man; and this fountain ſtands daily open for the juſtified man to flee unto with all his faults as they are committed, with renewing of his faith and repentance; for, ſo large is this Promiſe, <hi>Thou wilt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169976:97"/>caſt all their ſins, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As the ſenſe of the pardon of ſin, and freedome from the apprehenſion of Gods keeping it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, is a warme and refreſhing condition: ſo it would be much entertained, by frequent looking to God by faith and praiſe about it. Therefore yet again is the ſpeech directed to God, <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi>

                  <p>In the next place, God is commended as ſingular in his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fidelity, keeping the Covenant made with their forefathers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The priviledges of the Church, are made theirs by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and ſworn Covenant, and ſo are certain; for, ſo the Word ſpeaks of <hi>truth and mercy ſworn.</hi> 2. The Lord is to be ſeene and commended as incomparable in fidelity and promiſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, notwithſtanding all impediments in his way, and all our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him to the contrary; for, it is to be repeated, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that wilt perform the truth, &amp;c?</hi> 3. The ſumme of Gods Covenant with his Church is <hi>mercy,</hi> in reſpect of the fountain whence all his bounty floweth, and in reſpect of our ill deſervings which we ſhould daily ſee; and <hi>truth,</hi> in reſpect that the freedome of mercy in promiſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth nothing of the certainty of performance: but as <hi>mercy</hi> opens the doore, ſo <hi>truth</hi> keeps it open. Hence it is, that thoſe two are ſo frequently conjoyned in the expectations and deſires of Saints. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.3. and 61.7. 4. The Covenant of mercy is the Churches firſt and irrevocable priviledge; for, it is <hi>ſworn of old,</hi> and ſo the law which came after, cannot diſannul it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. 5. As the ſpiritual bleſſings of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to true believers, who may reckon <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with whom the Covenant was made, their <hi>fathers</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the faith: ſo even the natural poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> have a peculiar intereſt in that Covenant made with their fathers, not broken off by any interruption or deſolation, but to be ſtill forth-coming for them, as to their being called as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be his Church and people, if not alſo for giving them the promiſed land in heritage; for, ſo do they reckon while they are threatened with much enſuing deſolation; <hi>Thou wilt perform the truth to Iacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou haſt ſworn;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169976:98"/>&amp;c.</hi> For this cauſe the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. reckons, that Gods purpoſes toward them as a Nation, are among <hi>the gifts which are without repentance,</hi> and never to be recalled and made utterly void, more then in his dealing with his Elect, in the matter of their calling and glorification. 6. It is the duty of the godly, when they are called to trouble, to confirm their faith in the hope of iſſue, according to Gods promiſe, and be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſt ſatisfied therewith, accounting it ſweet to have hope of future mercy ſure, although it were never ſo long a coming, and the way to it never ſo rough; for, ſo do the godly, hearing tell of future deſolation, cloſe all, believing and reſting ſatisfied with this: <hi>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, &amp;c.</hi> for the accompliſhment whereof every godly man ſhould pray, <hi>Even ſo, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.

                  <p>The juſtice of God, taking vengeance on his enemies, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from the cauſe moving him to it, which is his jealouſie, or tender feeling of the injuries done to his honour and dear people; and from the ſeverity and certainty thereof, though ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for a time. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Vengeance executed by God, jealous for his people whom he loveth, floweth from great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and is moſt ſevere: for, <hi>the Lord revengeth</hi> all injuries, <hi>and is furious.</hi> The Hebrew word imports great fury, as of one (ſo to ſay, with reverence to him who ſpeaks ſo to our capacity,)
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169976:99"/>tranſported with it. 4 The juſtice and ſeverity of God againſt wicked men, would be ſeriouſly ſtudied, both by enemies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre them from doing evil, and by his oppreſſed people for their comfort; for, this repetition, <hi>The Lord revengeth, and is furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Lord will take vengeance,</hi> imports, that there ſhould be many thoughts of it. 5.

                  <p>This juſtice of God taking vengeance on enemies, is further deſcribed from the way of manifeſting thereof, which is flowly, but certainly; the Lord forbearing, neither becauſe he purpoſeth to forgive, nor becauſe he wants power; as may appear from his Majeſty and State, when he appeareth environed with whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes and tempeſts raiſed by his power, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.8,—11. and the airle clouds being as duſt, raiſed by his ſtately progreſſe, as armies raiſe duſt in their march: and this is one part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his power, for executing this juſt vengeance, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord, even toward enemies is long-ſuffering, and ſlow in executing of anger, that their deſtruction may be ſeen to be of themſelves, that in his holy providence they may ſtumble more upon his indulgence, and fill up their meaſure, and that his Churches faith and patience may be tried; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>The Lord is ſlow to anger.</hi> 2. When the Lord ſpareth his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it is not becauſe he is not able to meet with them, nor ought we to judge becauſe of any outward appearances, that they are invincible; for, how unlikely ſoever the deſtruction of enemies may be in the eyes of men, <hi>yet the Lord,</hi> who is <hi>ſlow to anger,</hi> is alſo <hi>great in power.</hi> 3. As the Lord is able to reach his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169976:100"/>enemies when he pleaſeth, ſo his forbearing of them, is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they ſhall be exempted altogether; but he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly give proof of his power in dealing with them as their way deſerveth; for, <hi>the Lord is great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.</hi> He will puniſh them, leſt his ſparing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſhould give ground to any to think that he <hi>held them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> or <hi>abſolved them as guiltleſſe,</hi> as the word ſignifies. 4. The Lord is able by his power ſpeedily to bring to paſſe greateſt things, and can, when he pleaſeth, overturn, confound &amp; darken all things, which appeared to be ſtable, well ordered and clear; for, ſo much doth <hi>his way in the whirlwind, ſtorm and clouds</hi> teach.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169976:100"/>of his power: from all which <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

The Lord doth give ſuch ample proofs of his power in his works of providence upon the creatures in heaven and earth, as may clearly confirm us in the faith of his omnipotency, which are therefore to be ſtudied, that we may be confirmed; this is held forth in what he doth dailyin the air in <hi>ſtormes</hi> and <hi>clouds, v.</hi> 3. and in what he can do upon <hi>ſeas, rivers, hills, &amp;c.</hi> whereof ample proof hath been given, as is recorded in Scripture. 4.

                  </q>
                  <p>From the former evidences of Gods power upon the creatures, the Prophet inferreth the inability of any to ſtand or endure when an angry God calleth them before his tribunal; and that becauſe his anger being attended with invincible power, would as a fire burn up all before it without mercy, and can overturn hard rocks, as at Chriſts death, and 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

It is a wicked imagination in men, that leads them to blaſpheme God, in denying his power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and mocking of his peoples confidence in him, or to think that this is the way to proſper: and it is a wicked counſel to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Gods people to renounce their confidence, and renounce the way of his worſhip, that it may be well with them; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all which God will not ſuffer to go unpuniſhed; for, thus alſo did <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and <hi>Rabſhakeh imagine evil againſt the Lord,</hi> and prove <hi>a wicked counſellour,</hi> as the ſacred Hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and for this is <hi>Aſſyria</hi> threatened. 6.

                  <p>Upon the back of this challenge they are again threatened with deſtruction, notwithſtanding of their quiet and ſecure conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of their confidence in their great multitudes: and this ſentence is further amplified from Gods end in it, which is to comfort his Church in <hi>Judah,</hi> that had been afflicted by the Aſſyrians, to whom he promiſeth that ſhe ſhould no more be ſmitten with that rod, but that by the deſtruction of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſhe ſhould be delivered from that ſlavery and bondage, under which ſhe had been held by them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As proſperity makes a people uſually fat and rank, ſo doth their waxing groſſe call for ſtroaks: for, they being <hi>quiet,</hi> became <hi>likewiſe many,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſhall be cut down</hi> or <hi>ſhorne;</hi> while the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Thus ſhall they be cut down</hi> or <hi>ſhorne,</hi> he either hath in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering this meſſage, uſed ſome geſture, repreſenting the way of cutting down or mowing; or, he alludeth to the ſignification of the word <hi>cutting down,</hi> which is uſed of cutting down rank graſſe, wool or haire, by ſharpened inſtruments, ſo ſignifying the cutting ſhort their flouriſhing and luxuriant condition; or, the word tranſlated <hi>thus,</hi> may be rendered <hi>likewiſe,</hi> as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before, and ſo it imports, that as they had taſted of peace, and likewiſe of multiplication: ſo ſhould they alſo finde <hi>cutting down;</hi> or, it may be rendered <hi>certainly,</hi> as it is frequently uſed in Scripture. 2. Nothing the creature can enjoy is able to hold off Gods ſtroak, nor needs he any time to ruine his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but can do it with one ſudden ſtroak; for, <hi>though they be quiet</hi> (free of trouble, and ſecure in their fortifications) <hi>yet ſhall they be cut down,</hi> and that <hi>when he ſhall paſſe through:</hi> or, with a ſudden ſtroak, alluding to the ſtroak on <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. 3. This repetition of the ſentence teacheth, how hard a thing it is to get threatened judgments believed in a proſperous condition; therefore the Lord doth again undertake it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had to oppoſe, And teacheth, that it is uſeful for the Church to look on injuries done to her, as a ſufficient quarrel to bring judgements on her perſecutors; for, therefore after that challenge, <hi>v.</hi> 11. the ſentence is again repeated. 4. The Lord would have his Church obſerving the kindneſſe ſhewed to her, and the benefits that redound to her by his judgements on the world, therefore doth he direct the ſpeech to her, that ſhe may obſerve it. <hi>Though I have afflicted thee, &amp;c.</hi> 5.

Albeit
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169976:104"/>the Church of God will never get an end put to her afflictions, until eternity come, when God ſhall wipe away all tears from her eyes; yet ought ſhe to acknowledge the Lords great mercy, in cutting off her preſent enemies, and giving a breathing time; for, ſo muſt this promiſe, <hi>I will afflict thee no more,</hi> be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this place, with relation to the preſent enemy, that the Church ſhould be free of their trouble, and enjoy a little reſt. 7.

As the Lord ſeeth it fitting, at ſome times to humble his Church, by bringing her into bondage; ſo he eaſily can, and in due time will ſet her at free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burſt thy bond in ſunder.</hi>

Such is the preſumption of wicked men, and the heartleſſe diffidence of Gods people, that Gods ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies is hardly received and credited: for, this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition ſheweth, that this truth is not eaſily inculcated. 2. It is ſufficient ground of aſſurance for the coming to paſſe of greateſt things, that the Lord hath determined they ſhould be; for, this is given as a ſure ground of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>'s ruine, that <hi>the Lord hath given a Commandment concerning thee,</hi> or purpoſed their deſtruction, his purpoſe concluding as effectually the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all means to bring it about, as if they were eſpecially commanded. 3. The Lord doth juſtly root out the memory of ſuch perſons or States, as make it their only work to get a name on earth, and to be eminent and terrible; for, ſuch is <hi>Aſſyria</hi>'s doom: <hi>No more of thy name ſhall be ſowen.</hi> 4. The threatening of the deſtruction of idols, as a ſigne of total ruine, ſhould put us in minde of the Lords great controverſie againſt idolatry and idols, in that he will ruine the worſhippers thereof, to ruine them: as alſo, if the cutting off of their idols was a ſigne of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction, how much more ought it to be grievous unto us, beyond any of our particular loſſes, when our God in his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The want of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, and the ſolemnities of worſhip is a bitter trial, however it may fare well with the people of God, in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate exerciſes of Religion, and in their inward conditions; for, ſo is alſo imported in that <hi>Judah</hi> may <hi>keep ſolemn feaſts.</hi> 5. Our eſtimation of, and reſpect unto the Ordinances of God, muſt be evidenced by our great alacrity in going about them, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after we have been deprived of them for a time;) and by our endeavoured thankfulneſſe to God for the enjoying of them; for, this ſpeech, <hi>O Judah, keep thy ſolemn feaſts,</hi> is a ſtirring up to alacrity, and the Command, <hi>Perform thy vowes,</hi> imports a ſenſible obligation to thankfulneſſe to God for the reſtoring of the Ordinances. 6. The Lord will cut off ſuch ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> as do moleſt his people in the free uſe of his Ordinances, be they never ſo potent; for, ſo is aſſured of the Aſſyrians; <hi>for the wicked,</hi> or, <hi>Belial ſhall paſſe no more through thee, he is utterly cut off:</hi> And this ſentence ſtands ſtill in force to be executed in due time, upon all thoſe who do trace the Aſſyrians footſteps, and imitate their ſins.</p>

                  <p>A reaſon is given why <hi>Nineveh</hi> might expect that the Lord would now come againſt her, though before ſhe had been by his permiſſion proſperous; to wit, that the Lord had by the Affy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, as his ſcourge, chaſtiſed <hi>Judah</hi> (for ſo much ſeems to be underſtood by <hi>Jacob,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) as well as the ten tribes, and overturned and trod under foot their proud gloriation in their excellencies; the one being totally depopulated and emptied by them, and the other deformed by the taking and ſacking of their towns and villages, which were as branches ſprung out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the mother-City; and therefore he would not ſpare <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but it was now time to take courſe with them, and caſt the rod into the fire. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord hath an eſpecial quarrel at the pride of his people, which ariſeth from the conſideration of their excellencies or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and will have it ſtained; for, <hi>The Lord hath turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Iſrael,</hi> and ſo ſpares it in none: and the ſame word ſignifying both <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> ſheweth, that as priviledges and conceiting of them, go often together: ſo the Lord abhorreth ſuch conceit moſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

                  <p>The army of the Caldeans, and their preparations and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> are more particularly deſcribed, 1. That the armour and cloathing chiefly of their Leaders, were red and bloody-coloured, to terrifie others, and hide their own wounds and blood, that the ſight thereof might not encourage the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor make themſelves to faint. 2. That their chariots both in preparations and aſſaults, for celerity, numerouſneſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fierce diſpoſition of ſuch as manage them, ſhould rage, juſtle and march nimbly as torches and lightnings, the iron of their wheeles ſtriking fire on the ſtreets. 3. That their lances, which were ſo many, as if a wood of firre-trees,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169976:107"/>were divided amongſt them, ſhould be ſhaken and managed to the terrour of the Aſſyrians. 4. That the Caldean King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his Leaders, and calling them by their names, they ſhall ſtumble for haſte to be at the wall to aſſault it, and ſhall ſet up defences under which they may fight with leſſe hazard; from all which <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. To adore the infinite Providence of God, who giveth by his Prophet an exact and particular account of every circumſtance in this action, as if it were already done, intimating, that his purpoſes, effectual providence and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, do condeſcend even to particular circumſtances of actions. 2. This large deſcription of their cloaths, garments, activity, &amp;c. teacheth, how terrible thoſe are, who are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to execute the Lords vengeance and controverſie, how ſtrong they are on whoſe ſide he is, and how formidable to thoſe whom he is to deſtroy. 3. If natural men, for their own ends of ambition and vain glory, may be made ſo reſolute, as to run ſwiftly on hazards, and care nothing for death or wounds, as here is declared, how much more ought the Lords people to be reſolute and couragious in reſiſting to blood, ſtriving againſt ſin, and in acting for God in their places and ſtations? 4. The practice of theſe men in <hi>preparing the defence</hi> under which they might fight, teacheth, that it is no true valour, even in natures eyes, nor warrantable, to run ſo deſperately on ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, as to neglect any lawful meanes of ſelf-defence.</p>

                  <p>To omit the various Interpretations of this verſe, I conceive it moſt clear to expound it of the Queen, (or, generally of the great Ladies,) who living before quietly and delicately, in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed or ſetled condition, as the word <hi>Huzzah</hi> ſignifieth, ſhall now be found out, and pulled away to go into captivity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with her maids, who having been with her in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; ſhall now condole with her, and lament her and their own miſeries. And this is the firſt effect of the taking of the City. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The moſt delicate and weak, and ſuch as have not been accuſtomed to hardſhips, may look for a change when they provoke God, how ſtable ſoever their proſperity ſeem to be; for, <hi>Huzzah ſhall be led away captive,</hi> or <hi>diſcovered,</hi> and <hi>ſpoiled, and made bare,</hi> as the word alſo ſignifieth, and it may be ſhe was handled ſo. See, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.56, 57. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.5. 2. As giving of ones ſelf to much delicacie, contributes to embitter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions unto them; ſo ſuch as have been companions in pleaſure, may contribute to ſet an edge on anothers grief; for, ſo are we taught by the example of this mournful company, brought out of pleaſure to miſery, and <hi>her maids leading her, tabring on their breaſts</hi> for ſorrow, do help to ſet before her the bitterneſſe of her condition. 3. It is an addition to common calamities, that the afflicted muſt ſmother their grief, and dare not vent it openly, for fear of further injuries from enemies, therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit women uſe moſt violently to expreſſe their ſorrowes, yet <hi>her maids lead her as with the voice of doves,</hi> which is a ſecret groaning and bemoaning, not daring to do it openly,</p>

                  <p>Another effect of the taking of <hi>Nineveh</hi> is, the flight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and defendants; which is amplified from her former condition; that, albeit ſhe had been of a long time, or ſince ſhe had a being, populous, rich, and at eaſe, not ſtirred with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, as a pond of ſtanding water, abounding with fiſh; yet at the enemies entry, ſhe ſhould be troubled and forſaken, and men ſhould for no intreaty ſtand to it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                  <p>The ſentence is enlarged, and the <hi>wo</hi> explained, wherein they are threatened, partly with the terrible preparations of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> coming againſt them, which he ſets out in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as if they were then entering the city, and the whips wherewith they drive their chariots, and the noiſe of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot-wheels and horſes feet ſounding in the ears of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and the weapons of the horſemen dazling their eyes; and partly they are threatened with execution and ſlaughter by theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which ſhould be ſo great, that the dead corpſes lying in the way ſhould hinder men to walk on the ſtreets, or to flee away. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. To be under a wo from the Lord, ſpeaks moſt bitter judgement; for ſo that <hi>Wo, v.</hi> 1. is expounded to partend ſo great and terrible ſlaughter; implying that whoſoever are under the Lords curſe, will meet with the like or worſe judgements, though it may be not ſo viſible to a carnall eye. 2. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God ſent forth in wrath upon his incorrigible enemies, will be terrible and dreadfull unto them, the very approach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be a kinde of death unto them before they be ſlain; for,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169976:111"/>therefore doth he threaten them with the ſounding noiſe, and dazling ſight of enemies, and their preparations and approaches, as that which would prove dreadfull to them. 3 Such as delight in blood and cruelty ſhall be recompenced of the Lord to the full, in their own coin; for, in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> given to blood, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>There is a multitude of ſlain, and a great number of carcaſes, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The judgements to come upon the enemies of the Church are to be look't on by the people of God as if they were already inflicted, that they may be comforted in that the Lord executeth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, and that they be not tempted with beholding the preſent proſperity of enemies; for, therefore alſo is every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this ruine marked, as if it were in acting, and the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> repreſented as dead corpſes by the Prophet.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Another branch of the Lords accuſation and quarrell againſt <hi>Nineveh</hi> is, that by her ſubtile and politick courſes, (reſembled to witchcrafts) ſhe enhaunced the wealth of other Nations, and brought them into ſlavery, uſing them for her own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that as harlots by their beauty and artifices do enſnare their Paramours, and bring them and their wealth in their power, ſo ſhe made uſe of her greatneſſe and power together with her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, to allure Nations to ſubmit to her, as if it had been for their own good. In this ſenſe <hi>horlotrie</hi> underſtood of <hi>Tyrus</hi> her merchandizing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.15, 17. However, I would not exclude another interpretation alſo; that as idolatry (which is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>whoredome</hi>) and deviliſh arts were frequent amongſt theſe eaſtern people, <hi>Iſay</hi> 2.6. and 47.13. So ſhe made uſe of theſe arts to carry on her deſignes of greatneſſe, and enticed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to embrace her idolatry, that ſo they might be united the more firmly unto her for her own advantage, as we ſee, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However men do oſtentimes glory much in their wit and skill in increaſing their greatneſſe, and outwitting others, yet before the Lord, ſuch ways are the ground of a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and nothing elſe but <hi>whoredomes</hi> and <hi>witchcrafts,</hi> as here we are taught. 2. Men are naturally immoderate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive in their deſire and hunting after greatneſſe; for ſuch are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169976:111"/>compared to <hi>harlots</hi> who commit <hi>multitude of wheredoms,</hi> and are never ſatisfied in their luſt. 3. Worldly and politick States and people, are ſtill to be looked on in all their dealings with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as ſeeking themſelves and their own intereſts onely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretend to the contrary; for, however <hi>Nineveh</hi> held out her beautifull condition to other Nations (as an harlot to her Paramours) to invite them as it were to their own benefit in being under the protection of ſo mighty a State, yet her real intentions were thereby to diſpoſe of them to her own uſe, as ſlaves which are bought &amp; ſold: <hi>the wel-favoured harlot, the miſtreſs of witchcrafts, ſelleth Nations through her whoredomes, and families through her Witchcrafts.</hi> 4 Wicked men are given to abuſe all favours and good things conferred on them by God, and make them ſubſervient to their luſts and deſignes; for, as harlots proſtitute their beauty to allure men to filthineſſe, that they may reap gain; ſo did <hi>Ninevch</hi> make uſe of her greatneſſe to allure others to joyn with her, to her own advantage, and their prejudice, <hi>the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured harlot ſelleth Nations through her whoredomes.</hi> 5. Men given to their luſts and worldly deſignes, uſe to make no ſcruple of unlawfull means to compaſſe their ends before they be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them; for, <hi>Nineveh</hi> was the <hi>miſtreſſe of witchcrafts,</hi> that is, of wicked policies and deceits, or (according to the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation) of devilliſh arts, that ſo ſhe might be great, and <hi>ſell families through her witchcrafts.</hi> 6. Wicked men make no account even of that religion which themſelves profeſſe, but in ſo far as it may be ſubſervient to their worldly ends; for, ſo doth <hi>Nineveh</hi> (according to the other interpretation) <hi>ſeil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions through her whoredomes.</hi> She did preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In oppoſition to her former beauty, the Lord profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf her party, threatens her firſt with ignominy and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her of her exellencies and ornaments, that ſhe may be loathſome and contemptible to all, as if an harlot were ſtript, and her cloaths caſt back over her head, that her nakedneſſe may be expoſed to mockery in the view of men, and as prophane ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers uſe to do with captive women.

He threatens to put yet more affronrs upon her beauty, by granting her enemies victory over her, and power to tread her down; as if women in their pomp were all befouled with dung, and ſo made loathſome. 3. He threatens, that by this means ſhe ſhould be made a publik ſpectacle, and the matter of horror and deteſtation to all beholders, there being none to comfort her <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods being an adverſary to the wicked, is neither ſoon ſeen by them, nor ſuppoſe it be ſeene, is the ſadneſſe of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition eaſily laid to heart; therefore is it again inculcated, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am againſt thee, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes,</hi> though it had been told before, chapter 2.13. 2 Abuſe of mercy will in the end reſolve in the abuſers miſery; for, beautifull <hi>Nineveh</hi> who plaid the harlot with it, <hi>her skirts are diſcovered,</hi> and <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable filth</hi> caſt upon her, and ſhe with whom the Nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication, is made the object of peoples deteſtation. 3. People in their greateſt pomp and glory, do but flie with borrowed wings, and are in ſuch a condition as God can eaſily ſtrip them of what they gloried in, and ſet them as contemptible objects; for, <hi>Nineveh</hi> hath <hi>ſhame and nakedneſſe,</hi> which he <hi>will ſhew to nations and kingdomes,</hi> when he ſtrips her of her borrowed glory. 4. As wicked men cannot enjoy honour and greatneſſe in the world, and not abuſe it: ſo the Lord is provoked thereby to plague the abuſers with ignominy; for, <hi>I will caſt abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile,</hi> ſaith he to glorious <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh.</hi> 5. The Lord will make ſuch as have publikly ſinned without repentance, to become publik ſpectacles of his juſtice and ſeverity, to the terror and aſtoniſhment of the beholders; for <hi>I will ſet thee as a gazing-ſtock, and it ſhall come to paſſe that all they that look upon thee, ſhall flee from thee.</hi> 6.

And in this example, 1. He rehearſeth the flouriſhing condition of that city, it was populous, or <hi>nouriſhing,</hi> that is, a great market-town, nouriſhing the countrey about it; it was ſtrong be ſituation, being built among the Channels of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and environed with ſtrong ramparts, the ſea alſo encloſing it on divers parts; it was alſo ſtrong by great and many confederates, ſuch as <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> or (<hi>Arabians,</hi> who are frequently named <hi>Cuſh</hi> in Scripture) <hi>Egyptians</hi> and other people of <hi>Africa</hi> wherein the ſpeech is directed to <hi>No,</hi> as inſulting over her vain
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169976:113"/>confidence in theſe to the terrour of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> 2. He repeats their ſtroak; That that City had been made deſolate, her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being carried captive, her young children daſhed in pieces, her honourable men divided amongſt the ſouldiers as prey, and carried away as ſlaves; as for the time of this deſolation, and the perſons by whom it was acted: it is needleſſe for us further, to enquire, ſeeing the Spirit of God puts it out of controverſie that it was done before the utter ruine of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> 3. This example is applied to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> wherein is ſhewed; that ſince ſhe had no more advantages then the other had, it was but folly to think her ſelf to be invincible; and ſhe is aſſured that how potent ſoever ſhe be, yet ſhe ſhall be drunk with the wine of Gods wrath; and that notwithſtanding her former ſplendour, ſhe ſhould be made to hide her ſelf for ſhame and fear, and become obſcure, as if ſhe had not been: and that ſhe ſhould notwithſtanding her own ſtrength, be forced to ſeek help from abroad, or to ſupplicate her enemies for pity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord hath given abundant proof that there is no power nor probable means of defence able to ſtand out againſt him when he proſecuteth a controverſie; for, ſo doth the bringing in of this inſtance teach. 2. Men are ſtill ready to be preſumptuous and confident of their own ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatever they ſee done to others; therefore is this example produced and applied, that her conceit may be thereby cruſhed: <hi>Art thou better then populous No? &amp;c.</hi> 3. Men have nothing to boaſt of as ſufficient to preſerve them from ruine, but others have had the ſame or better, who yet have ſuccumbed; herefore are all the circumſtances of ruined <hi>No</hi>'s ſtrength pointed out, to ſhew that ſhe might well have compared to <hi>Niuevch</hi> in any thing that would have ſeemed to be a defence. 4. The Lords minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſin and impenitent ſinners, is the ſame in all ages, and he will ſo declare himſelf by his judgements; for as <hi>No</hi> for her ſins <hi>was carried away, &amp;c.</hi> ſo is <hi>Nineveh</hi> threatened becauſe of her provocations: <hi>Thou alſo ſhalt be drunken, &amp;c.</hi> 5. The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may not only expect to be deprived of counſel and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſtraits as drunken men are, but to be totally overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the judgements of God in full meaſure; for, they are not to taſte a little of the cup of wrath, but to drink of it till they be drunken; <hi>Thou alſo ſhalt be drunken.</hi> See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.15, 27.6. The Lord can, and becauſe of ſin will, bury in obſcurity the greateſt of Nations, as if they had never been, and make them who made great ſhew of glory and courage, ſeek holes to hide themſelves in; for, ſaith he, <hi>Thou ſhalt be hid.</hi> 7. Unto ſuch
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169976:113"/>as are purſued by the juſtice of the Lord, their enemies are made terriblé, and all their ſtrength and preparations are not ſufficient to ſecure them from fear, or keep them from being brought into their enemies reverence; for, whatever <hi>Nineveh</hi> had to oppoſe, yet <hi>thou alſo ſhalt ſeek ſtrength becauſe of the enemie.</hi>

                  <p>This verſe holdeth forth the ſubject matter of this prophecie, which is chiefly grievous threatenings, firſt againſt the Jews, and then againſt the Caldeans, together with the Penman, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority of this Scripture, that he not only was a Prophet by office, but had this doctrine by viſion and ſpeciall illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In our making uſe of any portion of holy Scripture, we ought to begin at the ſtudy of the divine authority thereof, to the end we may labour to come to it with more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169976:117"/>conſidence, and with more of that ſpirit which endited it; for, therefore is it prefixed, that the Penman of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was <hi>a Prophet,</hi> and did <hi>ſee it</hi> in viſion. 2. The ſtudie of the divine authority of Scripture, may hide and take our mindes off, looking to, or ſtumbling at the weakneſſe or meanneſſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments carrying the ſame; for the Spirit of God thinks it a needleſſe work for thoſe, who take up this doctrine as a divine viſion to enquire much about the Penman, and therefore only expreſſeth his name and office, <hi>Habakkuk the Prophet.</hi> See, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.11. 3. The doctrine of divine vengeance againſt ſin and ſinners, being rightly conſidered, will be found ſad and inſupportable; therefore albeit all divine doctrine may be called <hi>A burden</hi> (as it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 1. in the Original) in regard of the weight it ought to have upon our ſpirits, whether directions, how to get them obeyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25. or comforts, how to walk anſwerably under them: yet in the ordinary Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, and by the Prophet here, the name is applied to threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: He calls this doctrine <hi>The burden,</hi> as being ſent from a God, burdened with the wickedneſſe of ſinners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.4. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 2.13. as being a grief and burden to the meſſengers to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch tydings, as being burdenſome to the ſecure, to hear their ſinful wayes contradicted and reproved, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.33. as being ſad to the penitent when they lay it to heart, as portending ſad ruine, however men account them but <hi>winde, Jer.</hi> 5.13. And finally, it ought to be a burden, that God, who delights to ſpeak in other termes to his Church, ſhould be provoked to write on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bitter things. 4. Albeit that vengeance on impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, being long forborne, may ſeem incredible, yet it is moſt certain and clear, that it is coming, therefore however that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure people bleſſed themſelves; yet the Prophet not only hears, but <hi>ſeeth</hi> their <hi>burden,</hi> as if it were preſent; and albeit the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gift of propheſying be ceaſed, yet every godly man may be as certain from the Word of judgements on impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as if they ſaw them with their eyes.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet in his own and the godlies name, begins at an expoſtulation with God, that the generality of the Jewes being ſo deſperately wicked, as he inſtanceth in ſeveral iniquities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially againſt the ſecond Table; yet the Lord in his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did bear with them, and took no courſe to vindicate his own glory, or abate this deluge of ſin one way or other. This complaint he amplifieth and aggravateth from other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereof the firſt is in this verſe, that he having taken ſo much pains on this people to no purpoſe, but their injuſtice ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up and breaking out in open violence, had been forced of a long time to cry to God againſt them: but neither was his prayer regarded, nor the oppreſſed ſaved from violence, which he thinks ſtrange of. We are not to underſtand this ſo as if the Prophet were quarrelling with God, or cruel to this people, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom he evidenceth ſo much tenderneſſe afterward, but that having long dealt with that people, and with God by prayer for ſome ſucceſſe to his Miniſtery, and finding iniquity to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to the diſhonour of God, and oppreſſion of the godly, he (not ſo much out of any hatred againſt them, as out of zeal to Gods honour, out of hatred of ſin, and pity toward the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) complains that there was no redreſſe of this, and that neither by amending of them, nor correcting of them, the courſe of ſin was ſtopped. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the duties of the ſecond Table are a touchſtone, whereby to try the ſincerity of thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe true Religion, and are within the viſible Church: ſo when Profeſſors once declare their unſoundneſſe that way, they may readily come to a very great height in it: for, here they were come to the extremity of violence, and combuſtions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 2. The ready way to make mens endeavours in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, (eſpecially ſuch as are employed in dealing with ſoules) effectual, is to be much with God in prayer: therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet having ſpent much time in vain, is put <hi>to cry</hi> to God about it that he would interpoſe; Cries to God are our beſt weapons againſt ſin. 3. The iniquity of a viſible Church may come to that height, that ſuch as would ſtand in the gap, may be ready, if not to cry againſt them, yet to ſubmit if God ſhould ſend judgements: for the Prophet is ſo put to it, with their ſin diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, and oppreſſing the godly, that he <hi>crieth,</hi> that God would one way or other ſtop the courſe of their iniquity. See, <hi>Numb</hi> 16.15. 4. Zeal for God and his honour, and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, ought to overſway our reſpects to any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: for, from this principle it is that the Prophet <hi>cries</hi> to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169976:118"/>God againſt this people, otherwiſe dear to him. 5. The truly godly, and eſpecially ſuch as are called to carry the Lords Name unto his people, are to lay their reckoning, not to have a ſmooth and eaſie life, but to wreſtle under much humbling, toile and vexation; for, ſuch was the Prophets lot here, and the godlies, in whoſe name he complains. 6. So unſearchable are the Lords counſels, as he may ſee fit to delay the anſwer of deſires, which are put up from much zeal to his glory, and compaſſion toward the godly oppreſſed, againſt ſinful men and their courſes; for, the Prophet here hath <hi>cried,</hi> and that ſo <hi>long,</hi> as he is like to quarrel and queſtion God about it, and yet the Lord did not <hi>hear nor ſave.</hi> 7. The patience of God toward his ſinful Church and People, doth ſarre ſurpaſſe the patience of the beſt of men; for, when the Prophet is wearie, and like to fall into impatiencie at Gods long-ſuffering; yet the Lord was not wearie to wait upon them.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond amplification of this complaint (which cleareth more the ground of his crying. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and ſetteth out more of their ſinne) is, that their wickedneſſe in vexing and grieving one another, and the godly amongſt them, and their violent ſpoiling of one another, together with their ſtarting and keeping up law-ſuits and contentions (or, of ſtrife againſt the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God, who reproved them, as was uſual, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.4.) that I ſay, all theſe were not only publick and open in the Prophets and godlies view, whereever they went, but a great grief and vexation unto them; their hearts were over-charged when they ſaw ſuch wickedneſſe, and God taking no order with it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When once men ſhake off the fear of God, it is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with him to give them up to break all bonds of love, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and civil ſociety amongſt men; for theſe godleſſe men are given up to <hi>iniquitie, grievance, ſpoiling and violence, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord ſheweth, how unfixed they are in all things, who hold not faſt the root of his feare. 2. It may be the lot of the Lords moſt faithful ſervants, to ſee ſad ſights of wickedneſſe among the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169976:118"/>people committed to their charge, inſtead of comfortable fruits of their Miniſtery. This Prophet after his pains taken, ſeeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>iniquitie and grievance,</hi> and every where <hi>ſpoiling and violence are before him,</hi> theſe ſinnes being ſo impudently committed, that the actors cared not who ſaw them. See, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.4. 3. Albeit it be the duty of the Lords people and faithful ſervants, not to carve out what ſhall be their own lot and ſucceſſe in the world, yet they ought not only to keep themſelves unſpotted, but to be ſeriouſly affected and vexed with the iniquities of the times: for ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Why doeſt thou ſhew me iniquity, and cauſe me to behold grievance?</hi> Not ſo much quarrelling with Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards him, as teſtifying his own and the godlies ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſeeing theſe things. See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. To be vexed with the evils of the time, is a way to keep our ſelves from falling into them, and a ground of hope that God will appear, as the Prophets reaſoning imports. 4. However the godly may be called to contend and ſtrive both for God and for their owne rights, yet it is a mark of an unſanctified ſpirit, to delight in the fire of contention and either to beget or entertain them need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely or unjuſtly: This was one of the vexing evils of the time, <hi>There are that raiſe up ſtrife and contention.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A third aggravation of his complaint (holding out yet more of the iniquity of the times) is taken from the conſequents of Gods indulgence toward that people, that they were emboldened to ſinne by it, and grew the worſe for that they were ſpared: for, when the Prophets preached, and men rebelled, and yet God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, they did hereby take occaſion to contemn the Law and Word of God as a dead thing, having no vigour nor authority, and ſo ran on all mad courſes, inſomuch that no juſtice was to be found; for, if there were any who reſpected equity or right, they were ſo overpowered with the multitude of wicked men, that they durſt not appear, not could effect any thing, and ſo juſtice could not chooſe but be wreſted. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It ſhould be the godlies endeavor to have their zeal againſt ſin cleanly, and ariſing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169976:119"/>upon juſtifiable grounds; for, here the Prophet cleares, that his zeal againſt the iniquity of the times, flowed not from any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice he ſuſtained thereby, but from the over-turning of all Religion and juſtice that appeared therein. 2. The Lords for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing and long-ſuffering oft-times prove a ſnare to wicked men, hardening them in their evil courſe; for, becauſe of Gods indulgence, <hi>Therefore the Law is ſlacked, &amp;c.</hi> 3. It is not the enjoyment of the Word of God or Ordinances, but their having authority and vigour in our hearts and practices, that will prove bleſſed in enjoying them; for, this people had the Law, but it was the quarrel, that it was ſlacked or dead in its authority: <hi>The Law is ſlacked;</hi> the ſimilitude is taken from the faint or life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pulſe of a dying man. 4. Contempt of the authority of the Word openeth the door to all wickedneſſe, and juſtice will go to ruine among men, where Religion hath no place; for, theſe two are conjoyned, <hi>The Law is ſlacked, and judgement doth never go forth.</hi> 5. It is a great height of a lands guiltineſſe when Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Courts of Juſtice become corrupt; for that is the height of their impiety, and the evidence of a deſpiſed Law, that <hi>Judgement doth never go forth, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Times of general defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction prove ordinarily times of great trial to the godly and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not only are their ſouls vexed, and they ſupplanted in their righteous cauſe, but they dare hardly appear againſt the ſtream of injuſtice; or, if they do appear, they cannot be able to effect any thing that is right, but all goeth wrong, do what they can; for, <hi>Then the wicked compaſſeth about the righteous, therefore wrong judgement proceedeth.</hi>

That it ſhould be a ſingular and wonderful deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, inſomuch that if any of the Heathen ſhould conſider it, it would breed admiration in them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.37. and 29.24, 25. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.8. or if the Jewes ſhould conſider any ſtroak inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Heathen, they ſhould admire that their owne ſtroak
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169976:119"/>was ſadder, as, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12. 2. That it ſhould be incredible to themſelves, who dreamed of eaſe, and yet be true. And 3. That it ſhould be ſpeedy, and come to paſſe, even in their time to whom this was preached. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When men harden themſelves in their evil wayes, becauſe of Gods for bearance, and the Word hath no authority among them, then the Lord will ſpeak in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other language by his rod; for, becauſe of that contempt of the Word, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. the Lord <hi>will work a work,</hi> that is, will ſend judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he will owne, and wherein he will be ſeen. 2. The Lords long ſuffering patience toward impenitent ſinners, will not alwayes laſt, but when their iniquity is come to an height, it will alſo end in ſad judgements; therefore albeit the Lords pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience had out-wearied the Prophets patience, yet now <hi>I will work a work in your dayes,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 3. As abuſe of mercie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Church, deſerves ſadder judgements then the ſin of Heathens, who have not ſuch an offer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.22, 24. So it is an addition to the Churches calamity, when the Heathen and enemies, who have been witneſſes to Gods working for her, ſhall become Spectators and Admirers of the hand of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her; both theſe are held forth in that Preface, <hi>Behold ye among the Heathen, and regard and wonder marvellouſly: for I will work a work, &amp;c.</hi> as hath been before explained. 4. It is uſual, that when judgement cometh upon an impenitent people, they attain not to any right uſe of it, but are ſurpriſed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and aſtoniſhment under it: for, ſo is fore propheſied even of the Jewes, that they ſhall <hi>behold, and regard, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der marvellouſly</hi> at their own calamity, and go no further. 5. This ſtupid diſpoſition, as it flowes from former contempt of Gods Word, which hath ſo ſtupified them as judgements cannot pierce; ſo it will prove fruitleſſe, and doth portend the further ruine of ſuch as continue in it; ſo the Apoſtle citing this place, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41. makes clear, that they are <hi>deſpiſers</hi> who <hi>wonder,</hi> as is alſo clear from <hi>v.</hi> 4. and that they <hi>wonder and periſh,</hi> or <hi>vaniſh,</hi> that is, as their admiration and aſtoniſhment uſually vaniſheth and cometh to nothing, without any fruit; ſo ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion portends ruine, and ſuch a ſtroak will undo a people, they not being able to endure and bear out under both the ſtroak and fearful aſtoniſhment accompanying it. 6. As the Lords judgements upon the Church may be far beyond the expectation of the Heathen and her very enemies, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.12. ſo it is juſt with God, that thoſe, who doting on their priviledges, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Word, ſhould meet with unexpected and incredible
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169976:120"/>judgements; for, ſo ſaith he to theſe prophane Jews: <hi>I will work a work which ye will not belive, though it be told you.</hi> 7. Divine indignation againſt ſin is more terrible, and will appear more ſad when it is inflicted, then ſecure ſinners do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily imagine: ſo much alſo is intimated, in that this work will be above belief; <hi>Ye will not believe, though it be told you.</hi> See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. 8. The contempt of the Goſpel, and the rejection of Chriſt, offered unto loſt man, is the height of iniquity, and draws on all the judgements, that at any time have been threatened againſt any ſin; therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41. denounceth the ſame judgement here threatened for contempt of the law, and ſins againſt the ſecond Table, to come upon the Jews who oppoſed the Goſpel, and rejected the Meſſiah, as being then fully accompliſhed when wrath came upon them to the uttermoſt, for caſting off of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet ſubjoynes a particular deſcription of this calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in deſcribing the inſtruments of it, the Caldeans under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> their King, whoſe diſpoſition, furniture and proceedings are ſo exactly ſet down, as may confirme the truth of the prediction, may ſet forth the juſtice of God in repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jewes in their own coine, may be terrible to the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted among them, and may confirme the godlies hope of a deliverance from the way of the Caldeans their managing that work. This deſcription is contained in ſeveral particulars; the firſt is, that they are a Nation of a bitter, cruel, fierce and active temper; who therefore, to ſatisfie their ambitious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, ſhould ſpeedily and without fear over-ſpread the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> not only to over-run it, but to make a Conqueſt thereof for themſelves. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When God hath a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie againſt a people, he will not want inſtruments by whom he may proſecute it; or, he can fetch <hi>the Caldeans</hi> from afar, who being already ſatiated with victories and conqueſts, needed not otherwiſe much to have minded ſo remote a corner as <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:169976:120"/>2. Inſtruments of vengeance upon the Church, would be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as imployed by God, and therefore the Churches eyes would be more on God then on them; for, <hi>Lo, I raiſe up the Caldeans,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 3. It is uſual for the Lord to give up troublers and oppreſſors of the world, to meddle alſo with his Church, that it may haſten their ruine, however the Church be ſinfull, therefore the Church is to be chaſtiſed <hi>by the Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were <hi>the hammer of the whole earth,</hi> Jer. 50.23. that this might haſten the filling of their cup. 4. The Lord can make holy uſe, even of the ſins of creatures, imployed for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of his judgements; for, <hi>He raiſeth up the Caldeans, that bitter and haſtie Nation,</hi> and makes uſe of this their temper, without any imputation to his holineſſe. 5. When the Lord armes any inſtruments with vengeance againſt a ſinfull people, they will not want diſpoſitions and ſucceſſe for attaining his end: for, if God <hi>raiſe up the Caldeans</hi> againſt the Church, then they are not only <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>fierce,</hi> but a <hi>haſtie</hi> or <hi>active Nation,</hi> and will <hi>march through the breadth of the land,</hi> without oppoſition or fear, and will not only overcome, but ſo carrie all before them, as they may <hi>poſſeſſe the dwellings that are not theirs,</hi> without moleſtation. 6. The Lord in executing vengeance, doth righteouſly proportion mens ſins and his judgements, and pay home tranſgreſſors in their own coine, therefore the Jews who had been cruel, meet now with bitter adverſaries, and they who had uſed <hi>ſpoiling and violence</hi> towards others, <hi>v.</hi> 2. are now over-run and caſt out of their own poſſeſſions. The like alſo may be read in the following purpoſe. 7. However men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it purchaſe good enough, when they are able by power to overturne others, and ſit down in their room, yet the Lord doth not ſo reckon, but will put a difference betwixt mens power or poſſeſſion and their right; for, albeit the Caldeans conquered <hi>Judah,</hi> yet in the Lords account, <hi>They poſſeſſe the dwelling places that are not theirs.</hi>

                  <p>The Caldeans imployed in this work, are yet further deſcribed, that being armed with divine vengeance, emboldened with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer victories, and exerciſing the ſame cruelly, they ſhould fill the land with terrour and dread of them, which they ſhould alſo tyrannically improve, and be their own carvers in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of advantage and honour, ſtanding to no law either of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Nations, in their dealing with a terrified and ſubdued people, but meerly following their own will armed with power <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Divine indignation purſuing ſinners, will take away their heart and courage in a ſtrait, and make their enemies ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them; for, ſo are the Caldeans to the ſinfull Jewes <hi>terrible and dreadfull.</hi> 2. When a people do not ſtand in awe of God ſpeaking from his Word to them, he doth righteouſly ſend judgements upon them, which will cauſe their hearts to faint; for, the Caldeans are <hi>terrible and dreadfull</hi> to theſe wicked Jews who ſleighted the Law, &amp; God Almighty ſpeaking in it, <hi>v.</hi> 4 3.

See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.13. and 48.40. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords hand would be remarked, in furniſhing the enemies of his ſinful people with all neceſſaries, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their enterprizes; for, therefore are the number and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Caldeans horſes, to carry them ſo long a journey, and make ſuch ſpeedy execution, recorded: <hi>Their horſes alſo are ſwifter then the leopards, &amp;c.</hi> 2.

As it is righteous with God to repay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with violence; ſo it is a very great ſinne to engage in war, whereby men and countreys are deſtroyed, without a juſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but meerly for the ſatisfaction of mens luſts; therefore do <hi>they come all for violence,</hi> in Gods righteouſneſſe, to puniſh the oppreſſing Jewes, and yet they ſinned in their quarrel and way, as minding only to runne them down, and to ſatiate themſelves. 2. The Lord ſeeth it fit, ſometimes to wink at the ſinnes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil men, and let them have ſucceſſe in their evil cauſe, when he hath his Church to puniſh by them; therefore albeit the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans be both inſatiable and preſumptuous, in that <hi>they come all for violence,</hi> yet it ſucceeds with them, <hi>their faces,</hi> or preſence, <hi>ſups up as the Eaſt-winde,</hi> raiſing a tempeſt, and carrying all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; and <hi>they gather captivity as the ſand.</hi> 3. The Lords juſtice is to be ſeen and adored in the ignominious ſtroaks which he inflicts upon his incorrigible people; for, ſo doth this ſtroak by the Caldeans import, that they ſhould come againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> not as a people to be fought with, but preyed upon; and that at their coming or face, they ſhould deſtroy all, and gather cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, poſſibly more then themſelves are; ſo baſe are Gods people when he deſerts them for their ſinne, though invincible while he is with them. 4. It may be the lot of the Lords Church, not only to ſuffer the calamities and deſolation of warre, but to loſe her liberty, which ſhe ſo much abuſed, and to be carried into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and bondage; for, the Caldeans <hi>faces ſhall ſup up as the Eaſt-winde, and they ſhall gather captivity as the ſand.</hi> See, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48. 5. The conſideration of the cruelty of men, and of the calamities that attend warre and conqueſts, ought to invite ſinners not to provoke God to give them up thereunto, ought to terrifie ſuch as fear not the threatenings of the Word, and ought to point out unto thoſe who are under ſuch a lot, the bitterneſſe of departing from God; for, for theſe ends are the Caldeans cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el deportments recorded, both for the uſe of the Jewes, while they yet continued in their preſent condition, and with reference to their caſe, when the threatening ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>

It is not an eaſie thing to put men from their carnal confidences, that they may humble themſelves before the Lord; for, all theſe things did the Jewes oppoſe to the threatening, to keep themſelves from being affrighted; and all theſe doth the Lord declare to be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they may ſtoop. 3. It is juſt with God to expoſe the greateſt of men to contempt and ignominious uſage when they provoke him, and do not employ their power and authority for him; for, the Caldeans in executing Gods controverſie, <hi>ſcoffe at the Kings, and the Princes ſhall be a ſcorne to them.</hi> 4.

                  <p>The Lord ſubjoynes to all this, as a ground of encouragement and hope to the godly, that the Caldeans, and eſpecially their King, would make a ſinful uſe of all their victories, and of this among the reſt, that he ſhall be ſo drunk with ſucceſſe, as his ſwelling thoughts of himſelf ſhall increaſe, and in his arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhall paſſe all bounds of modeſty and humanity, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he might ſeem to have; and ſhall grievouſly tranſgreſſe, in

Some inſtances of this carriage we may read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. and 5.4. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Proſperity is no leſſe a trial, to bring out what is in mens hearts, and no leſſe difficult to bear then adverſitie is; for here adverſitie tried the Jewes, and proſperity brought out more of the Caldeans naughtineſſe. Thus alſo was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> tried, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. 2. Albeit that many be employed in wars and making Conqueſts, yet there are but few who reap any great benefits by all their toile, the moſt part of the Conquerours as well as the conquered being but ſlaves to promote the ambitious deſignes of a few, and furniſh fuell to their luſts; for, notwithſtanding there were great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Caldeans, yet all this ſwelling, which they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fruit of their victories, is enjoyed chiefly by their King: <hi>His minde changeth, he ſhall paſſe over, &amp;c.</hi> 3. It is the plague attending proſperity in an evill courſe, that it is curſed to the enjoyers of it, and wicked men are plagued with pride by reaſon of proſperitie, and are encouraged, not only to over-run men, but to tranſgreſſe all bounds of modeſtie in themſelves, and to be more inſolent and bold upon ſinne; for, when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> prevaileth againſt the Jewes, <hi>then ſhall his minde change, and he ſhall paſſe over, &amp;c.</hi> 4. As it is a judgement for men, following a falſe Religion, to proſper in their oppoſition to the truth, and it is a further judgement, when men are not led to repentance by Gods liberal dealing toward them, but are given up to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a falſe religion, the more they proſper; for, this was a plague on the Caldeans, that being idolaters, and yet proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the people of the true God, they go on, and he <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, imputing this his power unto his god.</hi> 5. It is one of the difficult ſteps of mans life, and which will never be cleared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſure Word, to read the language of divine providence without miſtaking, and ſo father favourable diſpenſations right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſee aright who beſtows them, and upon what ground; to ſee what good things in men providence doth encourage, what evil it doth reprove; to obſerve whether the good ſucceſſe men have be becauſe of any good in their way, or for any evil that is in their oppoſites: Herein the Caldeans fail; for whereas the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them, and puniſhed <hi>Judah</hi> by them, not becauſe they were right, but becauſe of <hi>Judahs</hi> ſin, yet they applaud themſelves as if they had proſpered becauſe of their idolatry, and do impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit it be not the duty nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the truly godly to take pleaſure in the ſinne of any; yet it furniſheth ground of confidence to them, that God will own their quarrell in due time, when they ſee their enemies abuſing their proſperity, they will gather that inſolencie, and arrogancie ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed, that it ſhall not be a ſtable conqueſt, which is either holden of, or conſecrated to idols, and a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the diſhonour of the true God; for to this end, and to clear this truth, doth the Lord ſubjoyn their ſinful carriage here to their great ſucceſſe in the former verſes.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169976:124"/>immutability (who had alſo from of old been in Covenant with them, as the words will alſo bear) and his holineſſe, and from his purpoſe, power and providence in appointing the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans to puniſh and correct, but not to deſtroy the Church. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Judgements threatened or inflicted may ſpeak ſadder things to the apprehenſion of the godly, then God really intends by them; for ſo is inſinuated, that to <hi>die,</hi> or irreparable deſolation was preſented to their minde in this ſtroak. 2. As the Lord was pleaſed to continue a Church of the Jewes under the Law in the midſt of all their calamities; ſo he will never want a Church and people in the world, however he may correct; and he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict many judgements on a viſible Church, and yet not caſt her off: and he will be good everlaſtingly to the ſouls of his people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he toffe their bodies and their minds both in the world: all which ſhould be accounted of as great mercy in a time of captivity and ſad diſpenſations, for al this is held forth by way of gloriation in the Prophets ſpeech, <hi>we ſhall not die.</hi> 3. Believers having Gods promiſe, may humbly carve their own anſwer according to it, and when they come to God in Prayer may by faith tell him what they look for, and will get; therefore the Prophet ſaith to God, <hi>O Lord, we ſhall not die.</hi> 4. It is a character of the truly godly man, that in times of common calamity, he is publick-minded, and his care, Prayer and confidence taken up about the Church and the godly, and not his own caſe only; therefore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>We ſhall not die,</hi> that is, the Church and a ſeed of God in it ſhall not periſh. 5. Intereſt in God by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant made in a Redeemer, ſpeaks comfortable things in ſaddeſt times; for, the Prophet gathers his confidence from this, <hi>O Lord my God.</hi> 6. Such as are in Covenant with God, and have promiſes made unto them, will be notably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the faith of them by taking up the nature, properties, and way of God, the covenanting party, and promiſe-maker; for, thus doth the Prophet confirme his faith, that his God is <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> able to give a being to things promiſed, that he is <hi>from everlaſting,</hi> and eternall, and ſo is immutable in his purpoſes, and will eternally have a people to be his Spouſe and Subjects, as is gathered from the ſame attribute, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27, 28. that he is (as the words will alſo read) <hi>from of old the Lord my God,</hi> or the Churches God, by a Covenant of Grace, even before the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. and had proved ſo to that day, and therefore the Law would not diſannul that Coventant to ſuch as renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own righteouſneſſe, flee to God through Chriſt in that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169976:124"/>Covenant; and the Lord in his future diſpenſations would prove himſelf to be like himſelf of old; and laſtly, he confirmes his faith from Gods holineſſe, that he is <hi>mine holy One,</hi> without all ſpot of impurity; and therefore as he diſapproveth ſin, and puniſheth it in his people: ſo he will not ſpare it in enemies; far leſſe will he rub any imputation on his holineſſe, by falſifying his Covenant and promiſe made to the Church and elect in it, as is imported, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.6. and 85.35. In ſumme, <hi>they that know his Name, will truſt in him, Pſal.</hi> 9.10. 7. As faith muſt not expect to go on without much oppoſition from within; ſo it is the duty of a Believer not to ſuccumbe or give it over at every appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or tentation, but to ſet himſelf againſt it, and ſhame himſelf from it by venting it to God: This is imported in the way of the Prophets expreſſing his confidence, <hi>Art thou not from everlaſting?</hi> not importing his totall heſitation or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning of this: but rather that as Gods diſpenſations miniſtred occaſion to his weaknes to apprehend death, ſo alſo when he would faſten faith on God, ſenſe did queſtion his attributes, which his heart riſing againſt, he ſhames his own unbelief by venting this queſtion to God; wherein he holds forth the abſurdity of ſenſes apprehenſions, that as it would take away the believers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in queſtioning promiſes: ſo alſo it would turn atheiſt, &amp; deny unto God the glory of his attributes; &amp; withal ſhews that the way of curing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God is ſovereign Lord in all calamities, and doth ſet bounds and limits to them, which (whatever either the power of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or greatneſſe of trouble inflicted by them ſeem to threaten) ſhall not be tranſgreſſed; therefore doth the Prophet reckon that the Caldeans being ſent out <hi>for judgment,</hi> to puniſh the Church, yet ſuch as might keep within bounds of fatherly <hi>correction</hi> and reproof or to plague and puniſh the rebellious, and correct, and not deſtroy the godly and Church; and that being <hi>ordained or eſtabliſhed,</hi> or ſolidly founded and ſupported for that work only, and that by <hi>the Lord,</hi> who is <hi>mighty</hi> in power, or <hi>a rock</hi> (as the word is) unalterable in his purpoſes, therefore they ſhould not be permitted to go beyond his commiſſion and purpoſe, but they ſhould do his work and pleaſure, not their own; <hi>we ſhall not die, O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Prophet having confirmed his faith of the preſervation of the Church, ſubjoynes an expoſtulation, that the Lord being ſo pure and holy, as that he cannot ſo much as look upon any ſin wherein men approve themſelves, and for pardon and purging whereof a Mediatour is not ſought unto, far leſſe on groſſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unjuſt grievance of others, without indignation and anger; yet he ſhould ſeem to take no notice, but did tolerate the <hi>Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in their treachery and violence againſt the Church, who, though ſinful, were more righteous then their perſecutors; and that he ſhould rather puniſh the Church then them. In which complaint there is not only an expreſſion of the godlies weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wraſtlings under ſuch diſpenſations; but their faith alſo is inſinuated, that as God in his holy indignation at ſin, had not ſpared the Church; ſo he would not long wink at the <hi>Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> iniquities, but puniſh them in due time, and deliver his Church. This way of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> upon which he grounds the expoſtulation, is gathered from the former prediction, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7 <hi>&amp;c. Doct.</hi> 1. Such is the weakneſs and inſtability of the ſpirits of the Lords people, and ſo various the occaſions of exerciſing their graces, that they meet with few diſpenſations within time, wherat their hearts are not ready to quarrel; for the Prophet formerly complaining out of zeal, that God took no courſe with the ſins of his people, and yet getting an anſwer he is not ſatisfied, but his compaſſion findes new matter of exerciſe and complaint. 2. The cleareſt ſighted Saints may be ſo bemiſted, as not to be able to reconcile Gods diſpenſations, with his nature and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, but be ready to apprehend a repugnancy betwixt them; for here the Prophet cannot wel reconcile Godsholineſſe with his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating of the <hi>Caldeans.</hi> 3. We are ſo weak and ſelfiſh, that when providence works not according to our minde and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, we are ready to ſuccumb under temptations of Atheiſm,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169976:125"/>and to queſtion Providence; for the Prophet looks on God, as <hi>looking on,</hi> and <hi>holding his tongue,</hi> as a Spectator onely, when he tolerated the <hi>Caldeans.</hi> 4. It is the duty, and will be the care of all the godly to juſtifie God, and clear him from any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, however their weakneſſe cannot ſee through all the deep myſteries of his Providence about his Church and her enemies; and for that end they ſhould prevent misbelife and temptations language with ſomewhat of faith. therefore the Prophet in the midſt of his dark miſts, begins with this as an unalterable ground, (what ever his heart ſay) that God <hi>is of purer eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However the Lord have juſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt, and will in due time puniſh the groſſe iniquities of men without the Church, yet conſidering the many aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of leſſe ſinnes within the Church, and Gods jealouſie over his people, and care to have them reclaimed from every evil courſe, it is no wonder to ſee the Churches ſins (though leſſe in their own nature) puniſhed, when more groſſe ſins without the Church eſcape for a time unpuniſhed; for, the Prophets complaint, that God <hi>holds his tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then be,</hi> imports that God doth ſo, and Gods doing of it proves it to be a righteous act, however we may quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. 7. The Lord makes uſe of wicked inſtruments to puniſh his people, that in the foulneſſe of the rod he may diſcover the yileneſſe of their ſin: for this end are the <hi>Jewes devoured by the wicked,</hi> and by men viler then themſelves.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169976:126"/>their wickedneſſe, gives ground of hope that he will at laſt reckon with them: for, this expoſtulation of the Prophets imports this truth, that the holineſſe of God would not alwayes fit with this, but in the end would right it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet ſeconds and cleares his expoſtulation concerning the enemies wickedneſs from two grounds, whereof the firſt is taken from their unjuſt and violent conqueſt and oppreſſion; for by their oppreſſion men were no otherwiſe dealt with then irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creatures, ſuch as fiſhes, where the greater devoure the leſſer, or creeping things wanting rulers, who run over other, and are trodden down by every foot; or yet further, that men ſhould be like fiſhes, not only devouring one another, but expoſed as a prey to every one who can firſt catch them; that as fiſhes are eaſily taken, and (when nets and draggs are made uſe of) in great numbers: ſo men and multitudes of people and Nations ſhould without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty be preyed upon by oppreſſors and that as nets and drags do promiſcuouſly draw all to land: ſo oppreſſors ſhould get liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty promiſcuouſly to over-run Nations good and bad, the Church as well as others, thoſe who never wronged the oppreſſors as well as they who injured them moſt, &amp;c. All this the Prophet cannot ſee how it ſhould conſiſt with the holy Providence of God, and therefore layeth it before him to clear and conſider. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are very ready to grow upon our hand: and the more we think on them, we may ſeeme to have the more ground to ſubſcribe to them; and therefore as faſt as they are ſuggeſted to us, we ſhould tell them to God, as the Prophet doth here with his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169976:126"/>fertil invention in expoſtulating and complaining. 2. Men are ſo naughty by nature, as if the Lord would let looſe the reines of a reſtraining Providence, and give them up to themſelves, the world would become monſtrous; for, ſo doth the Prophet teach; <hi>men</hi> would be <hi>as the fiſhes of the ſea, as the creeping things which have no ruler over them.</hi> 3. It is an evidence of monſtrous and brutiſh wickedneſſe, when men acknowledge no rule of right and wrong, but power, and imploy all the power they have for uſurpation upon others; for, then indeed men <hi>are as the fiſhes the of ſea and they take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net and go her them in their drag.</hi> 4. Man being exalted of God above the creatures, it is a great abuſe when their way and lot from others debaſeth them from that dignity, that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>Caldeans</hi> ſhould live in the world like monſtrous beaſts and <hi>fiſhes,</hi> depraving the image of God after which they are made, and obſerving no ſhadow of equity, and that the oppreſſed ſhould not be uſed as rational creatures made after the ſame image, but as <hi>fiſhes taken up with the angle, &amp;c.</hi> 5. However we be unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with diſpenſations, yet it is our ſafeſt way, and a ſtep to our iſſue, to keep Gods providence about them ſtill in our eye; for, thus doth the Prophet better his former thoughts of God <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and holding his tongue,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>Thou makeſt</hi> (for the ſpeech is ſtill directed to God) <hi>men as the fiſhes of the ſea, &amp;c.</hi> 6 It beſeemeth the Lords providence well to reſtrain brutiſh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, to ſee to right and wrong in the world, and to protect the weak and poor from the ſtrong and mighty, or give a redreſſe when they are injured by them; for, the Prophets reaſoning imports, that it would beſeem God not to <hi>make men as fiſhes of the ſea, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he proved in due time.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ground of the Prophets expoſtulation (clearing yet further the <hi>Caldeans</hi> wickedneſſe) is taken from their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of their ſucceſſe, and that the Lord ſhould permit them not onely to do wickedly in their purchaſing, but yet more wickedly in their boaſting and inſulting becauſe of their victories, and in their glorying in their own wiſdome and ſtrength, as if by them they had conquered the world, and made themſelves feaſts and a good life. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Evil purchaſe is not ordinarily well uſed, but the purchaſers are given up to inſolency, conceit of themſelves, and luxury which are the uſual plague and ſnare of proſperity; for, <hi>therefore</hi> (that is, ſeeing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169976:127"/>they ſpeed in oppreſſion) <hi>they rejoyce and are glad, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſacrifice unto their net, and burn incenſe unto their drag; becauſe by them their portion is fat, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Diſpenſations are then ſaddeſt to the godly, when they ſeem to miniſter occaſion to men to deprive God of his honour, and to exalt any other thing or way beſide him, as the Authour of their felicity; for, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Prophet, that <hi>they ſacrificed to their net and drag; becauſe by them</hi> (as they judge) <hi>their portion is fat.</hi> 3. When men have troubled themſelves and the world alſo to make themſelves great, the reſult of all will be but a poor addition to their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that which may be as well wanted as enjoyed; for, all that the <hi>Caldeans</hi> reap, is, that <hi>they rejoyce and are glad, that their portion is ſat, and their meat plenteous;</hi> that is, they have good chear and a merry life, and yet they who want ſuch abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance live as well they, and they who are mean may have as much joy and contentment. 4. God will not tolerate, but in due time puniſh mens inſolency and gloriation in their unlawfully purchaſed pleaſures; for, the Prophets expoſtulation on this ground which at laſt gets a ſatisfactory anſwer, teacheth ſo much.</p>

                  <p>Upon all theſe grounds the Prophet concludeth and inferreth that however the <hi>Caldeans</hi> had gone long and far on, yet the Lord would bring their violent courſes to ſome end, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to empty their net, that they might ſpread it for new purchaſe; nor ſo much as permit them to enjoy their deſired end in their oppreſſions, (as if a fiſher ſhould not empty his net when he had taken his fiſh) and that becauſe of their bloody cruelty toward all the Nations under their power, in proſecuting their ends. This he propounds by way of queſtion, to teſtifie his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and zeal againſt its being over-wiſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods people may meet with &amp; apprehend many things in his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which will be matter of much vexation and provoke much indignation in them; ſo much do theſe queſtions teach. 2.

                  <p>The Prophet having vented his grief, and plunged himſelf in temptations and confuſions, begins now to recollect himſelf; and as a watch-man attends eagerly on his watch-tower, to get intellgence of any danger for the good of the whole City: ſo he being a watch-man to the Church by office, reſolveth by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and prayer to wait for a viſion in anſwer to his expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he had argued with God; whereby alſo he might be able to quit his own reaſonings, and to ſatisfie the people who were ready to quarrel at thoſe hard tidings concerning their ruine, and did utter to him againſt Gods dealing that which he had expreſſed in his expoſtulation. By all which he cleareth that he took not up the enſuing Meſſage at his own hand, but that he had it from God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It's our ſafeſt way in times of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perplexity, not to lie down under diſcouragment, but to recollect our ſelves, and ſix our eyes on God, who onely can clear our minds and quiet our ſpirits; therefore the Prophet after his deep plunge in temptation, <hi>ſets himſelf</hi> to look to God, and get ſomewhat to <hi>anſwer upon his arguing,</hi> or <hi>reproof</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation,</hi> (as the Originall will bear) that ſo his minde may be ſettled. 2. It is by the Word that the Lord cleareth dark caſes, and would have his people anſwer their temptations, and ſilence their reaſonings; and a temptation ariſing upon the proſperity of wicked men is a knot that can onely be loofed by God ſpeaking in his Word; for, the Prophet <hi>watcheth to ſee what be will ſay to him,</hi> or <hi>in him,</hi> by way of viſion, and every believer ſhould ſeek to the Law and Teſtimony for this end. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73, 16, 17. 3. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, earneſt Prayer, withdrawing of our mindes off from things viſible, and elevating them towards God, are the means in the uſe whereof God revealeth himſelf and his minde from his Word to his people in dark times. This was the <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>tower</hi> whereon the Prophet expcted his viſion, and whereon Saints may expect Gods ſecrets revealed from his Scriptures. This doth lift us up above the miſts wherein things below are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times covered to our ſenſe and will help to lead us ſafe thorough amidſt the deluſions which are frequent at ſuch times. 4. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters ought to acquit themſelves like watchmen in a city or army, to be awake when others ſleep, to be watching with God, and over the people, ſeeking after faithfull inſtructions which they may communicate, ſeeking to be filled from heaven with light and life, that they may pour it out upon his people, and all this eſpecially in hard times; for, this doth the Prophet profeſſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169976:128"/>to be his practice. <hi>I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon the tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay, and what I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> 5. As the Word of the Lord, for moſt part, gets but evil entertainment in hard times, and ſharp Meſſages meet with hot diſputers againſt the equity thereof; ſo peoples diſpoſitions at ſuch a time will give faithfull meſſengers much to do, and many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands to God, for the Prophet (beſide his own arguings within himſelf) was beſet with <hi>reprovers, arguers</hi> or quarrellers at theſe meſſages, which puts him the more earneſtly to <hi>ſtand and watch to ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what I ſhall anſwer when I am reproved.</hi> 6. Albeit the Lords people may have their own debates and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings betwixt God and them, yet it is their part to ſmother theſe as much as they can, and to bring up a good report of God and his way to others: for, however the Prophet afterward records that expoſtulation which he had with God, Chap. 1. yet it appeareth, that in the time he had ſo carried himſelf before that murmuring people on Gods behalf, as they were arguing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him, and he <hi>reproved</hi> by them.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord anſwers his ſervant attending on him, by giving him a viſion, which is afterward recorded, <hi>v.</hi> 5. &amp;c. and this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he is commanded to publiſh clearly, and make it plain to every ones capacity, and to affix copies thereof on the gates of the Temple, or other publike places, (as is reported to have been their cuſtome) and that in ſo legible characters and plain termes, as every on might without difficulty read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However it may ſeem to be in vain for ſouls plunged in perplexities to pluck up their loines, and eye and wait on God, yet the experience of the Saints proves it to be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching trade; for, <hi>the Lord anſwered me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, who had waited for an anſwer from him in his perplexity. 2. It is the will of God that what light or ground of encouragement is given to any in a ſad time, be made forth-coming for the good of others; for, the Prophet is commanded to <hi>write the viſion</hi> for the uſe of the Church, which though it was his duty by vertue
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169976:129"/>of his peculiar office, yet it may be a pattern for every one ſo to act within their ſtation. 2. It is the Churches great advantage, that in her hard lots ſhe hath the minde of God in his Word; whereby ſhe may expound his dealing with her, her dutie in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe, and what ſhe may expect concerning her ſelf, her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and troublers; for, there is a <hi>viſion</hi> here, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is to <hi>write</hi> for her uſe. 4. The Lord hath ſeen it fit in his deep wiſdome, and rich love, and for preventing all occaſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, forgerie or miſrepreſentation, and for helping of our forgetfulneſſe, and perpetuating his truth in the world, not only to deliver his minde to his Church by word of mouth, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or by his Prophets, but to leave it on record in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with her; on which ſhe may build her faith as certainly, as if God were immediately, or by his Prophets ſpeaking to her by Word, from day to day; therefore is the Prophet command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to write the viſion,</hi> on which the godly were to reſt their faith in an hard time. 5. The approved way of publiſhing Gods Word is not when it is adorned with wiſdome or excellency of words, but when it is delivered in ſimplicity and plainneſſe, condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the capacity of the meaneſt: for, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Make it plain upon Tables, that he may run that readeth it.</hi> 6. The Word of God is depoſited with the Church, not to be read and made uſe of by ſome ſort of perſons only, but indifferently by all the members of the Church, and accordingly is fitted to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of all; for, this written viſion is not to be hid up in a ſtrange language, and dark expreſſions, but to be made <hi>plain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tables, that he that runs may read it.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord ſubjoyns a reaſon to this command, (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a premonition to the godly, concerning the ſubſequent meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) to wit, that the performance of his decreed vengeance, revealed in this viſion, had its prefixed period, before which it could not be accompliſhed, and at which it ſhould certainly come to paſſe; and therefore the godly were to look much to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169976:129"/>revealed viſion, and laying aſide all fervour and haſte, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to wait for the accompliſhment, which ſhould be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and timely, however their ſenſe might judge the contrary: <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the mercies promiſed to the Church, ſo alſo the timing of them is in Gods hand, ſo that we are not to expect that the performance of comfortable promiſes, or of threatened vengeance againſt enemies, will be always ready at our call, but muſt wait the Lords time, who hath his own ſeaſons for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, trying, and delivering; for, <hi>The viſion is yet for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 2. The Lords delaying to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, diminiſheth nothing of the certainty of performance of what he hath promiſed to the Church, or threatned againſt her enemies: for, <hi>The viſion hath an appointed time,</hi> and an end pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, ſo that the exerciſe will not be perpetual; and at this time it <hi>ſhall ſpeak,</hi> to wit, by performance; though we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value other expreſſions of it, yet then it ſhall ſpeak to our ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>and not lye,</hi> nor diſappoint us, whatever feares we have to the contrary. 3. Such is our weakneſſe, haſte and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, that when the Lord delayes to perform promiſes, or what he hath foretold in his word, we are ready to think that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to do it at all, which is to contradict the Scriptures verdict here publiſhed, to remove ſuch apprehenſions; <hi>Though it tarry, it will ſurely come.</hi> 4. When we do not ſimply doubt of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain performance of Gods Word, yet we muſt not expect to have ſenſe ſubſcribing to all which faith apprehends concerning Gods method in performing; but faith wil oft-times ſee cauſe to ſpeak in contradictory terms to ſenſes verdict; for, <hi>Though it tarry, it will not tarry,</hi> ſaith he; ſenſe will ſoon weary, and ſay the performance <hi>tarrieth,</hi> when the Lord ſatisfieth not its haſty deſires, but out-wearieth all carnal confidence and ſtrength; But faith will ſay, that conſidering Gods love and wiſdome, his holy purpoſes in filling the cup of the enemies, &amp; bringing good to his people out of every delay, conſidering our duty, and the exerciſe of graces we are called to when he delays, conſidering that his performances come never out of date; and when matters were paſt all recovery, but that ſtill when he comes he makes up all, as if he had come the firſt hour; &amp; conſidering that there is ſtrength enough in God to carry through till deliverance come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29, 30, 31. Faith, I ſay, conſidering all theſe, will ſay, <hi>it will not tarry,</hi> but comes in a ſeaſonable and the beſt time, and before we be fit for it, by performance of theſe duties required in a time of ſuch exerciſe by delays. 5. The faith of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169976:130"/>Gods certain and ſeaſonable coming to help his people, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them patiently to wait for him, without limiting of him, and without taking a wrong way, his iſſue being worth the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for in his own way; for, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> 6. In a time when the Lord ſuſpends the performance of his Word, as Miniſters are ſo much the more to inculcate and cry up the ſure Word, neither eating it becauſe of delayes, nor ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to probabilities; ſo it is the duty of the godly in ſuch a time, to be much in ſtudying the Scriptures, to fraught their hearts full with promiſes, that they may commend them, and be ſupported by them: for, <hi>The viſions being for an appointed time,</hi> is a reaſon why the Prophet is commanded, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>to write the viſion, and make it plain, &amp;c.</hi> 7. It is a ſweet help to make us lean to the Word, when we ſtudy to ſee Chriſt in it, ſomewhat of him held forth and promiſed in it, and he in whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> engaged for the performance of it: therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37. in ſtead of <hi>the viſion,</hi> holds forth Chriſt as the ſubſtance of the thing promiſed, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty engaged for the performance, <hi>He that ſhall come, will come, &amp;c.</hi> and this maketh this particular promiſe concerning the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> applicable to all the difficulties of the Church, becauſe Chriſt is alſufficient for every need.</p>

                  <p>The Lord cleareth his purpoſe and end in delaying to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and fulfil the viſion, which is to try and diſcover who are the lofty and unſound, and who the truly righteous, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth all of their hazzard in that time of exerciſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the truly godly how they may ſubſiſt and hold out. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Times of Gods exerciſing his Church, by not appearing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly for her, are times of narrow trial, and diſcovery of ſoundnes or Hypocriſie; for, ſo doth the Lord teach us, that <hi>the lifted up ſoul and the juſt</hi> ſhall both appear in their own colours, when <hi>the viſion is yet for an appointed time.</hi> 2. The manner of mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in a time of trial and tentation, is of great importance, and much notice is taken of it by God, as tending much, either to his honor or diſhonor, and to the promoting of our own peace or diſquiet; therefore a <hi>Behold</hi> is prefixed to this doctrin. 3. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169976:130"/>affliction and trial ought to be an humbling exerciſe, yet without Gods bleſſing, and meeting with corruption, it wil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and bring forth much pride, and high towers of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſwelling againſt Gods ſoveraignty, that he ſhould have the diſpoſing of us at his pleaſure, cenſuring his way of proceeding with us, conceiting of wiſdom and power to ſecure our ſelves, better then by waiting on God, &amp;c. for, then there will be ſome <hi>whoſe ſoul is liſted up.</hi> 4. As a proud, murmuring and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpoſition under trouble, diſcovers mens unfoundneſs, ſo it will not long wait on God, but make apoſtaſie, either from a general profeſſion of being his followers, or from keeping his way to the uſe of ſinful means, becauſe of which the Lord doth and will teſtifie that he doth abhor ſuch decliners; for, <hi>His ſoul which is lifted up, is not upright in him;</hi> and the Apoſtle in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. clears, that the proud ſoul will <hi>draw back,</hi> and that Gods <hi>ſoul will have no pleaſure in him.</hi> 5. Albeit that trial will ſift narrowly, and diſcover the naughtineſs of many, yet there are ſtill ſome who find grace to ſubſiſt, and get through in hardeſt times; for, in oppoſition to the former the Lord ſubjoynes, <hi>But the juſt ſhall live.</hi> 6. The way of the godly in patient waiting on God in hard times, is neither a ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtupidity, hardening themſelves in ſorrow, but an exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, feeling and lively way; nor is it a poor and ſorry ſhift, but a comfortable means of ſubſiſtance; for, <hi>the juſt ſhall live,</hi> he ſhal have a lively exerciſe, and a life of it. 7 Before a man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a comfortable way of bearing trouble and waiting on God in hard times, he muſt firſt make ſure his perſonal recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and being righteous before God, which will be onely when by faith he layeth hold on Chriſts righteouſneſſe offered in the Goſpel; for, he muſt be <hi>the juſt</hi> and that <hi>by faith,</hi> who <hi>ſhall live by faith</hi> in trouble, and ſo it is expounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. &amp; 8; The man who is juſt and righteous by faith in Chriſt, ſhall not onely live a life of grace, begun here, by dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conſtantly under the ſhadow of imputed righteouſneſſe, whereby he is hid from death and wrath, and by drawing life and vertue out of Chriſt to quicken his heart, and to enable him for every good word and work, and perfected in glory, but alſo his faith will carry him through, (not only the ſnares of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but) hardeſt diſpenſations, without apoſtaſie or fainting; for, while the righteous man walks not by preſent ſenſe, and by faith takes up God as his father in Chriſt, ſtudies all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to Saints in every condition, and magnifieth the truth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169976:131"/>of them; ſeeth God his Father to be the carver out of all his &amp; the Churches lots, and that every condition is uſeful, and hath a bleſſing in it to the godly; and that waiting on God in his way is the ſure path to a bleſſed iſſue; and withal finding now and then Gods preſence ſenſibly with his Spirit; while, I ſay, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is thus exerciſed, he cannot but have a good life, and be hid from the blaſty winds of tentations, wherewith others are aſſailed and blown over; <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> his ſaith ſhall afford him a life in hardeſt times, and provide for him in wilderneſſes. 9. Albeit that many may be believing in Chriſt, and ſo be born through, who yet cannot diſcern faith in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet ſuch as expect righteouſneſſe through faith in Chriſt, and by faith to be thus ſupported in evil times, ſhould ſtudy the reality and ſincerity of their faith, that it is not a motion or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but real and ſuch as he hath a ſure hold of; for, it is <hi>his ſaith</hi> by which <hi>the juſt ſhall live,</hi> a faith which he hath made ſure he hath. And for this end, we ought to ſtudy exactly the nature of faith, that neither the preſumptuouſly ſecure, nor fainting ſoul miſtake their own caſe.</p>

                  <p>Followeth to the end of the Chapter, the viſion it ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſtruction which was to come upon the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> propounding for the moſt part in general denunciation of Gods vengeance upon groſs and impenitent ſinners, ſuch as the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> were, wherein the Lord threatneth wrath and ſad judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come upon them for the groſſe abominations (ſuch as ambition, covetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, ſenſuality, carnal policie, idolatry, &amp;c.) which abounded amongſt them. This contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie the Lord layeth out in ſeveral branches, ſometimes repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame things in ſubſtance, and amplifying them from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conſiderations, to the end there may be a more diſtinct &amp; clear ſight of the ſinfulneſſe of their ſin, of the vanity of the pretences they founded their courſes on, and of the equity of God judgments ſubjoyned to every branch. The firſt branch of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169976:131"/>the controverſie is, that the Chaldeans, and in ſpecial, their King, being given to ſenſuality and ambition, or drunk with pride and ambition as with wine, was inſatiable in his Conqueſts like death and hell, or the grave (of which, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.15.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.14.) and not being content with his own portion, did labour to adde one Kingdom after another to his dominions. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the godlies honeſt wreſtling through an evil time by faith, is an evidence that God wil reckon with their oppreſſors: ſo the Lords reproving and puniſhing the Apoſtaſie of any within the Church, may aſſure men that he will not ſpare wicked enemies; for this is ſubjoyned to what was ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. with a <hi>Yea alſo,</hi> or <hi>How much more?</hi> importing that when he made the juſt to live by faith, he would alſo reckon with the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> and if he diſcovered and puniſhed the liſted up ſoul, how much more the <hi>Chaldeans?</hi> See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18, 2. The moſt part of unrenewed great mens actions and enterpriſes, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the ſervice of their vile luſts; For, <hi>Becauſe he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth by wine, and is proud, he keeps not at home,</hi> his great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes are undertaken to ſatisfie ſenſuality and ambition. 3. Men once inſlaved to the ſervice of their luſts, do become brutiſh, and in a manner renounce their very reaſon; for, ſo may the words alſo be read, <hi>The proud man tranſgreſſeth as through wine;</hi> he is drunk with ambition as with wine, which depriveth men of the uſe of ſenſe and reaſon. 4. It is a ſin flowing from ambition, &amp; a violence offered to nature, which is content with little, when men cannot acquiſce in their lot and portion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them by God, eſpecially when it is competent, but doe by all means hunt after more; for, it was the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſin and ambition, that having a Kingdom, yet he <hi>keeps not at home.</hi> 5. It is the Lords judgement upon ambitious men, that the more they go beyond bounds to ſatisfie their luſts, they become the more inſatiable; the more they drink, they are the more thirſty; for, ſuch an one <hi>enlargeth his deſire as hell, and is as death, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied, but gathereth unto him all Nations, and heapeth to him all people.</hi>

However the oppreſſed and ſubdued may ſeem to be far behinde with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors and Oppreſſors, yet the Lord will in due time cleare that there is but little cauſe for ſuch an apprehenſion, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oppreſſors wil meet with their own ſtroak, wherein the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt may inſult over them, and they ſhall be rather the object of pitty then of envy, or on whom any would wiſh more cruelty; for, <hi>All theſe,</hi> (to wit, the nations ſubdued by him, <hi>v.</hi> 5. even all of them, and thoſe who were ſoreſt ſmitten) <hi>ſhall take up a parable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and a taunting proverb againſt him, and ſay, Wo to him.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.4,—12. 4. As unjuſt Conqueſt gives a man no right to his Purchaſe: ſo it brings on Gods curſe, and at laſt makes the Purchaſer an object of deriſion; <hi>Wo</hi> here may be taken, both for an inſulting expreſſion, &amp; a declaration of a curſe upon him; <hi>Wo to him</hi> (or <hi>Wo he,</hi> by way of triumphing over him, and laughing at him) <hi>that encreaſeth that which is not his.</hi> 5. Though the oppreſſed ordinarily groan under the oppreſſor, and wiſh his end, admiring at Gods patience toward him, yet it may be concluded, that oppreſſion ſhall not continue ſo long as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the oppreſſed or oppreſſor might expect, and that diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the oppreſſors hopes of continuance in his way, ſhal be matter of deriſion; for, all this is imported in that part of the proverb, <hi>How long?</hi> 6.

The Lords judgements on impenitent ſinners come unexpectedly, and when they leaſt imagine, and that oft-times by inſtruments little thought of, till God raiſe them up and employ them; for, <hi>They ſhall riſe up ſuddenly and awake,</hi> to bite and vex.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169976:133"/>they who <hi>ſpoiled many Nations, ſhall be for booties and be ſpoiled.</hi> 3. Although oppreſſors, ſo long as God permits them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his vengeance, prove invincible, yet when their day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they will be as feeble as any; for, the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-time had no more to do but come and gather ſpoile, are now for <hi>booties</hi> unto their enemies, who as eaſily ſpoile them. 4. Although oppreſſors dream that they have all under their feet who could harm them, ſo that none dare open the mouth, or move the wing or peep, yet the Lord hath a ſcourge ready when he pleaſeth to avenge himſelfe upon them; for, <hi>all the remnant of the people ſhall ſpoil thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord; He hath either nations hid from their fury, whom they think not worth their anger, or the very remnants of ſpoiled nations, who if he employ them, will do their turn. 5. When the Lord denounces or executes his judgments on bloody oppreſſors, it is uſeful to ſtudy much his controverſie againſt them, that we may father his judgments aright, may adore the righteouſneſs of God, and may learne from their example to abhor all violent and bloody courſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially againſt Gods people, which he ſo ſeverely puniſheth; therefore he ſubjoyns, that all this is <hi>becauſe of mens blood, for the violence of the Land, and of the City, and of all that dwell therein;</hi> which is to be underſtood with ſpecial relation to <hi>Judah.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond branch of Gods controverſie (held forth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms) is that out of a deſire to build ſtately Palaces, (as the <hi>Chaldean</hi> did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 29, 30.) or to the end they might eſtabliſh themſelves, and their poſterity in perpetual greatneſſe and wealth, and be exempted from the common miſeries of mankinde, and that no after-times might move them, they are extreamly and ſinfully covetous, for which the Lord pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them accurſed <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The certainty of Gods judgments on particular ſinners and enemies, may be read from general denunciations againſt ſuch ſins, it being agreeable to the rule of juſtice, that all who do ſuch things ſhould be ſo puniſhed; therefore the Lord accuſeth and threatneth the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in a general ſentence; <hi>Wo to him that coveteth, &amp;c.</hi> that it may
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169976:133"/>appear how agreeable to juſtice his ſentence againſt them is, and that every ſuch ſinner in after-times may put in his owne name, as if he were the man pointed at. 2. It is a plague on wicked men, when they are given up to imagine that their proſperous condition ſhall never change, but that they ſhall be able to ſecure it for them and theirs for ever; for, this is the proſpering wicked mans thought, which brings him to woe, that he will <hi>ſet his neſts on high;</hi> as birds do to ſecure themſelves and young ones, and to <hi>be delivered from the power of evil.</hi> See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49.11. 3. Mens vain imaginations and their apprehending that which will never be, and wherein all others have failed, doth oft-times prove a great ſnare to engage them in courſes which otherwiſe they might ſee, not only to be ſinful, but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and fooliſh; for, becauſe the worldly man thinks that he can ſecure uncertain riches to him and his, &amp; can guard againſt any emergent evils to which mankinde for ſin are condemned; therefore <hi>he coveteth an evil covetouſneſſe, that he may ſet his neſt on high, &amp;c.</hi> and ſtands upon no meanes which he thinks will make that lye in his right hand prove a truth. 4. Albeit men may lawfully, and in duty ſhould endeavour the good of their poſterity, even in external things, and may ſtudy to prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, which may prejudice them, yet this endeavour proves ſinful, when either it ariſeth from, or tends to greedineſs &amp; covetouſneſſe, or inſnares men by drawing them to the uſe of ſinful meanes: for, <hi>Wo to him that coveteth an evil covetuouſneſſe,</hi> though it were even for <hi>his houſe,</hi> or <hi>that he may ſet his neſt on high, &amp;c.</hi> 5. It may be ſufficient to deter men from courſes; that the Word declareth them to be ſinful, and that a curſe followeth them; for, ſo doth the Word import here, that it is <hi>an evil covetuouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>wo is to him that coveteth it,</hi> therefore men ſhould be far from it.</p>

Albeit covetous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors do oſt-times carry themſelves in great ſtate, as the only honourable of the earth, yet their way is in it ſelf ſhameful, and will end in ignominy; <hi>Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe.</hi> 2.

There needs no more to pull down the family of the oppreſſor, then his way of ſtudying to make it great; his very building, his neſt is a plague to it, and enoug to make it totter; for, thereby he <hi>conſults ſhame</hi> to it. He could do no more, if he had bended his wits to ruin it. 4. The Politick projects of men, who lean to their own wit for compaſſing their ends, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect piety, or to wait on God for counſel, will prove ſhameful &amp; ſinful; men who lean to their own wits, will finde, that their moſt ſerious conſultations will leave them in the mire: <hi>Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 5. It is a high degree of impiety, and a clear preſage of ruin, when a man in managing his affairs, caſts off all his love to his neighbours, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindes himſelf only, but ſtands not upon the prejudice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to riſe upon their ruins, or to cut them off, though never ſo many, and he but one, if he think it; may tend to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for, <hi>Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe by cutting off many people.</hi> 6.

This courſe the Lord pronounceth to be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, however they gilded it over with ſpecious pretences of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, or that thereby they endeavoured to perfect &amp; ſettle their civil State. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169976:135"/>and endangereth himſelf by following it to get it proſecuted, or reſcued, ſo ſhould they periſh in their hunting after wealth, and with it; See the like threatning, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.58. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1.

The utmoſt of mens endeavours ſhall not promote or perfect a work which God is againſt, nor uphold what he hath a minde to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow; for, though they <hi>labour and weary themſelves,</hi> yet it ſhall <hi>be for very vanity,</hi> and to no purpoſe. 3. Such as by bloody oppreſſion ſeek to exalt and eſtabliſh themſelves, ſhall not only loſe their labour, but incur further dammage by their attempt and loſe themſelves, their work, &amp; the materials which they had to begin their work upon; for, the Chaldeans <hi>ſhall labour in the very fire,</hi> which ſhall not only breed them toil &amp; pain in labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſhall devoure all their conqueſts, themſelves, and the Kingdom of <hi>Babel,</hi> which they had when they began their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. 4. The Lord will ſo order his judgments upon violent oppreſſors, as that his hand ſhall be viſibly and remarkably ſeen by all, to be the inflicter of them, and he ſhall prove himſelfe omnipotent, by fruſtrating men of their wicked purpoſes, and conſuming all their labours; for, <hi>Behold, is it not of the Lord of hoſtes, that the people ſhall labour in the very fire, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord ſubjoynes a reaſon to this ſentence, clearing how he ſhould be ſo much ſeen in this judgment, to wit, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſeemed to let his own Name and glory be obſcured, when he ſuffered the Chaldeans to oppreſſe the world, and lead his people into captivity, yet in due time he would make his glory ſo conſpicuous in their juſt deſtruction, and his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſerting of <hi>Judah</hi> into liberty, as the Nations ſhould be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the knowledge therof, as the ſea is full of water: &amp; all this as a type and pledge of the glory to be revealed in Chriſt, &amp; the knowledge of his Name then to be communlcated. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When oppreſſors do proſper, and the Lords people with the reſt of the world are brought into bondage by them, the Lords
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:169976:135"/>glory is engaged for his appearing againſt them in due time; for, it is ſubjoyned as a reaſon of the Chaldeans evil ſucceſſe; for, <hi>the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The greatneſſe of oppreſſors doth contribute to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and ſet forth the glory of God in bringing them down, and therefore is rather an argument why the Lord ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, then any hinderance to it; the Lord wil bring down the Chaldeans: for in ſo doing, <hi>the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of his glory,</hi> See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 9.16. 3. As God is moſt glorious in himſelf, ſo he will make his glory to ſhine in the deliverance of his people, though for a time he ſuffer them to be in bondage; for, in bringing back <hi>Judah</hi> at the ruine of <hi>Babylon, the Earth ſhallbe filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</hi> See. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 126.2. 4.

                  <p>The fourth branch of the controverſie, if we take it properly holds forth a denunciation of vengeance to come upon them for their beaſtly luxury and ſenſuality, uſual in the Babyloniſh Court, &amp; that not only in their own perſons, but they did draw one another to drunkenneſs, that ſo they might mock at their infirmities, which they could not hide in their drunkenneſs (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to that of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9.21, 22.) or that they might abuſe one another in an unnatural way, through their drunkenneſs; And ſo it teacheth, 1. When men abuſe their proſperity to luxury, it is an evidence of a curſe upon them and it; ſo it was with the Chaldeans: <hi>Wo to him that gives his neighbour drinke, &amp;c.</hi> as having no other end wherfore he troubled all the world but thus to abuſe himſelf and others. 2. Sin is come to a great
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169976:136"/>height, and neer a curſe, when men do entice &amp; draw others to the ſame exceſſe of riot with themſelves; for, <hi>Wo unto him that giveth his neighbour drinke, that putteſt thy bottle to him, and makeſt him drunken alſo</hi> 3. It is a beaſtly diſpofition, to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in making men abuſe themſelves by drink, a <hi>Wo</hi> is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt it; nor is it a mark of any true kindneſſe, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane reckon, but it is done, <hi>that they may look on their nakedneſſe</hi> and bring it out to open view. 4. Intemperance is an uſher to let in any other vice; for when a man is drunk, diſcovering of, or <hi>looking on nakedneſſe</hi> will not be accounted ſhameful, nor unnatural filthineſſe an abomination. But the words may alſo be taken figuratively, and ſo the ſcope is to taxe them for their endeavours, by Politick practices and faire promiſes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their neighbours in their undertakings, and that as they were drunk with ambition themſelves, ſo they filled their neighbours with the like principles, &amp; drunken heaps of ſharing in their victories, though indeed they minded nothing leſs, but if any inconvenience ſhould befal their Confederates, they would deſpiſe them, or be ready themſelves upon occaſion, to bring them unto ſlavery, and to make them baſe. Thus doth the whore make the world drunken with her Idolatrous cup, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and thus did <hi>Nineveh</hi> entice the world with her whoredom and witchcrafts, <hi>Nah.</hi> 3.4. This interpretation teacheth. 1, Great men in the world are ordinarily ſo infatuated with their hopes and projects that like drunken men they reel, &amp; cannot be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor ruled by ſound principles: for, the Chaldeans are thus drunken, and they <hi>make their neighbours drunken alſo,</hi> as well as themſelves. 2. Carnal policy and intereſt is the greateſt Steers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of humane affaires among men, which frequently brings a curſe on the uſers thereof; for, <hi>Wo to him who thus gives his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour drink, &amp;c.</hi> 3. No true kindneſſe can be expected from men who walk politickly and on intereſts of State, pretend what they will: for all that ſuch do this way to others, is, <hi>that they may look on their nakedneſſe.</hi>

                  <p>Whatever way we expound the challenge, the Lords judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very equitable, that all theſe courſes ſhould tend rather to their ignominy then their honour; and that as they had been Butlers to draw others to ſenſuality, and to intoxicate and allure them to joyne in their oppreſſions of the Church and the world; ſo the Lord ſhould bring about the Cup of his wrath to them, and make them drink of it to ſatiety, whereby they ſhould be as contemptible, as when a drunken man is lying naked, and that with his uncircumciſed foreskin (which was an abomination to the Church) uncovered, or when he is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting all his bravery or ſtately houſe with his filthy vomite, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169976:137"/>ſo to do. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Few of thoſe who receive greateſt things of this world from God, do acknowledge him for them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow Idol-gods to his diſhonour, and in defiance of him; for, ſo did the Chaldeans, as it is imported here, and ſo the moſt part of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity do. 2. In a time when Idolaters do prevail, &amp; the true Church is brought into bondage by them it is neceſſary to ſtudy much the vanity of Idolatry, and to ſet it out ſo to the world, to the end that neither the wicked may dream of being exempted from vengeance by their Idols, nor the godly ſtumble at the proſperity of ſuch as follow them; for, to theſe ends doth the doctrine of the vanity of Idols here ſet forth, tend. 3. Beſides fearful Idolatry committed in the world by mens taking that for their god which is no god; (whereof they cannot be free, who perform religious worſhip, due to God only, to any creature whatſoever) the world is alſo guilty of Idolatry by making of Idols or Images for repreſenting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Deity, and the object of their Religious worſhip, be it what it will, and by worſhipping of them in that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtate and relation; this is it which is expreſſely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Chaldaans here, that they not only accounted that to be their god which was no god, but either a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or a feigned thing, but that they had <hi>graven Images,</hi> and <hi>molten Images;</hi> not that they acknowledged theſe to be their gods, but that they were repreſented by them, and that their god were to be worſhipped in &amp; by theſe Images: &amp; this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge is expreſſed in general ternies, that all who make uſe of ſuch devices in Religious worſhip, (be the ultimate and laſt object of their worſhip what it will) may take their reproofe. 4. Whatever men may conceit of Images, as many wayes uſeful for exciting of them, and keeping them in remembrance of a Deity, yet upon narrow ſearch it will be found that they are unprofitable, if not pernicious; as every thing in worſhip, which is not inſtituted of God for profit, proveth; for he puts it to any unbiaſſed conſcience to tell, <hi>what profiteth the graven Image?</hi> 5. The original and Authors of Images prove the vanity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in any Religious ſtate: for, ſince it hath the maker thereof among men, <hi>what profiteth it?</hi> for it cannot be God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.6. and albeit the maker thereof give it a being, and hath graven it curiouſly, yet he hath no authority to command it to be worſhipped, nor can ſuch an Author make it bleſſe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers; and it is folly in the maker thereof to truſt therein, yea, it doth ſufficiently diſgrace any point of Religion, that it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169976:138"/>is of mans making or deviſing. 6. Albeit that men do commend Images as books for the ignorant, whereby they may be helped to take up a deity, yet they can teach or repreſent nothing of God; but only the makers phantaſic; yea, they cauſe the minde to wander from the true and ſaving knowledge of God, as he is revealed in his word, and do imprint falſe and equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of a deity; for, <hi>the molten Image is a teacher of lyes.</hi> 7. Though ſuch as make uſe of Images to repreſent a deity, or that which they worſhip, do imagin that they reſt not upon the repreſentation, but do aſcend up by it to the thing repreſented: yet herein their heart deceiveth them; for whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in their thoughts, yet practically they honour them as their god, and whatever they pretend to offer unto God in and by them, is expounded by God as offered really unto them; for <hi>the maker of his work,</hi> (though he might have made any other thing of the materials) <hi>truſteth therein.</hi> 8. Such as worſhip graven Images, do proclaim their own brutiſhneſſe, and that they are as great blocks as theſe which they adore, when they exalt that which is below themſelves, to be above themſelves, &amp; in Gods room; for, what a brutiſhneſſe is it in a man endued with ſenſe and reaſon, <hi>to make himſelfe dumbe Idols,</hi> which have no ſenſe at all?</p>

                     <p>A Prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet upon Sigionoth.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Inſcription of this exerciſe holds forth the Prophets ſcope, which is to pen a prayer to God, in reference to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing calamities, ſuch a prayer (as the word ſignifieth,) as is made by a Supplicant to a Judge, which becauſe it was penned in Meeter for the help of memory, therefore the tune is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the clear ſignification whereof though it be uncertain, yet that which cometh neereſt to likelihood is, that the Prayer being endited in a compoſed &amp; mixt Meeter, it was to be ſung with variable tunes &amp; inſtruments fitted accordingly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169976:139"/>when the Lords people abuſe their priviledges, they may be put to plead for them before the Lords tribunal by prayer, and be content to hold faſt theſe things by faith, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they had full poſſeſſion of; for <hi>Hab akkuk</hi> and the Church are put to prayer for their very being, and to deprecate the total ruine of Gods work. 2. It is the duty of all in a time of imminent or incumbent judgements, to ſtirre up themſelves and others, in their ſtations, to get the ſpirit of prayer, that being exerciſed in religious duties, they may be kept from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining or fainting, and may be preſerved from the judgement of ſenſeleſſe ſtupidity, which uſually attends ſuch times, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.22. Therefore doth the Prophet by his example ſtirre up, and by this publick forme (preſcribed by the Spirit of God, and therefore lawfull) direct the Jewes how to imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their captivity. 3. The people of God are not to expect that their prayers will hold in one tenor under trouble, but as their exerciſe will be various, in fearing, believing, trembling, rejoycing, &amp;c. ſo their prayers may begin low, riſe high, fall low, and riſe high again; for, ſo much may be gathered from the nature of this meeter, wherein the prayer is penned, or tune to which it was ſung, called <hi>Sigionoth,</hi> or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable; as of one wandring here and there, and not keeping one way: This appeareth clearly in the prayer it ſelfe, or the Prophets ſubſequent exerciſe, and ſuch variety makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort and melody of that ſpiritual exerciſe more ſweet.</p>

                     <p>O Lord, I have heard thy ſpeech, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: O Lord, revive thy work in the midſt of the yeers, in the midſt of the yeares make known, in wrath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mercy.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This verſe containes that which is properly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prayer in this exerciſe; the ſumme whereof is, that being afraid of Gods threatned and imminent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Captivity, (to which he ſubmits without more contending) he prayeth that the Lord would not ſuffer his Church nor his work in it to come to nothing by their captivity; but would, during that time, keep in their life by undeſerved tokens of his favour, till he ſhould deliver. And that notwithſtanding their ſinnes procuring wrath, he would
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169976:140"/>magnifie his mercy toward them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When judgements are threatned againſt the Church, albeit ſhe may believe love in them, and that ſhe is the Lords whatever come, yet threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned trouble ought to be an exerciſe unto her, and ought to make her humble under Gods threatning hand, and tremble to deal with ſuch a bitter cup; <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have heard thy ſpeech,</hi> to wit, concerning the Captivity, <hi>and was aſraid.</hi> Both the Majeſty of the ſpeaker, and the matter of the ſpeech did affright him. 2. As prayer to God is the kindly vent of all the godlies feares, without which fear might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily cruſh them, and by which the thing feared is either removed, or bleſſed, and made more eaſie and comfortable unto them; ſo prayer will not ſpeak well in trouble, where there is not ſome ſenſe of Gods word threatning, or of his hand ſtriking at the root of it; for the Prophet being afraid, ſubjoynes, <hi>O Lord, revive,</hi> as the iſſue and reſult of his feare, and as being a ſuitable and fit time and diſpoſition for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 3, When the Lord hath diſcloſed his purpoſe, concerning his peoples being in trouble, it is the duty of the godly to ſubmit without contending, and make them forbearing of it, till Gods prefixed time of deliverance come; for, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſuppoſeth that the appointed yeares of the Captivity were to come, and doth not quarrel as formerly, but prayeth that the Church may be borne through in that time. This were a way to make many a croſſe eaſie, which our quarrelling makes inſupportable. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 29, 5.6. 4. The people of God are ſometimes left to lie under a long continued tract of trouble, to the end they may be narrowly tryed, and may have much ſorrow to be repayed with joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.15. for this trouble did endure for years, even ſeventy of them. 5. Beſides the Lords general relation to all his creatures as his handy work, he hath a peculiar relation to his Church and people, whoſe calling to be his people, and their building up and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that priviledge, is his own peculiar worke, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom his elect are made anew by him, in a worke of redemption and regeneration, ſo that they become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the worke of his hands, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.11. In the midſt of whom alſo he hath a work of his Ordinances and Kingdome to be preſerved and carried on: Which relation, as the Church ought to acknowledge it, and hold all ſhe hath of him, and make his worke the matter of her chiefe care in trouble; ſo this intereſt doth indeare the Lords people to,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169976:140"/>him, and is a cauſe why he will not let them go to ruine, and ſo loſe all that himſelfe hath done; for, ſo doth the Prophet reaſon, <hi>revive thy work.</hi> 6. The Lords people and worke may by reaſon of long and ſore Captivity, and (poſſibly) deſertion accompanying it, be redacted into ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as all may ſeem to be in peril of ruine, and the faith of the godly in peril to faint, and give it over: There may be ſuch low ebbes, as may put the godly to pray, <hi>O Lord, revive,</hi> or <hi>preſerve alive.</hi> 7. As the Lord both can, and will preſerve his work, and people, who wait on him, from ruine, and that in the midſt of extremities: ſo the Lords doing of this ought to be much eſteemed; therefore, the Prophet reſolving on Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, maketh it his ſuite which he hath warrant and ground of hope to aske, and the granting whereof will be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though the trouble otherwiſe be preſſing: <hi>O Lord, revive thy work in the midſt of thy yeares.</hi> 8. It is a very refreſhful diſpenſation, and which the people of God have warrant to look for, that the Lord will ſeaſon and ſweeten their times of trouble, with ſome evidences of his favour, either in their boſomes, or by ſome token for good in his providence. Therefore the Prophet is directed to pray further, <hi>in the midſt of the yeares make known,</hi> to wit, his wonted favour, by ſome manifeſtation; and was anſwered in the Lords raiſing up of Prophets to them in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and by raiſing up the head of their King, about the midſt of the yeares of their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.27, &amp;c. as a pledge of their future libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by other favours beſtowed upon them. 9. As the Lords proceeding in wrath againſt his people would undoe them; ſo the apprehenſion of Gods juſt anger againſt them for their ſinnes, is a great hinderance to them in their prayers: Therefore the Propher, when he thinks on wrath, is made ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly to cut his prayer, that he may runne and deprecate it; <hi>make known,</hi> (ſaith he, not expreſſing what) <hi>in wrath remember mercy.</hi> 10. As the Lords juſt indignation againſt ſinne doth not ſo tranſport him, as that he will forget mercy, or that he will deal in ſtrict juſtice, without all moderation, with his afflicted people: ſo this may give warrant to all thoſe who are ſenſible of ſin, and of wrath due, or inflicted for it, to flee to his free favour, and to pray with the Prophet, <hi>In wrath remember mercy.</hi> And teacheth all to magnifie God, when this prayer is anſwered in any ſort, and that God doth mixe a cup of wrath with any mercy or moderation.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Prophet that he may ſtrengthen his own, &amp; the godlies faith, in aſſurance of an anſwer to his prayer, gathereth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeveral grounds whereupon he expects it; which are taken from the manifeſtations of God in delivering his people from <hi>Egypt,</hi> in carrying them through the Wilderneſſe, and ſetling them in the promiſed Land; expecting by faith that the Lord (being unchangeable, ſtill the ſame, and the people ſtill his) will repeate theſe in their future delivery; and ſo lifts up his heart above all difficulties in the captivity, or that might impede their reſtitution; as looking to what had been done, as pledges of what God would do, before his Word failed, or they periſhed.</p>
                  <p>Gods glorious manifeſtations of old, among and for his people, are branched out in ſeveral particulars; whereof the firſt (agreeing much with <hi>Deut,</hi> 33.2.) is the Lord mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting of himſelf on Mount <hi>Sinai.,</hi> at the giving of the Law, and on the hills adjacent in the deſert, through which he marched after giving of the Law, before his people, as their conſederate God, in glory and Majeſty like himſelfe; inſomuch that the ſplendor, wherwith he was invironed, filled heaven &amp; earth, &amp; was bright as any light: &amp; though theſe rayes like horns which ſhined forth from his hands or ſides when he appeared, did point out his power, yet but darkly; as being but a veile caſt over his glorious power which in it ſelfe is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as that light could not be ſtedfaſtly looked upon by the infirme and eaſily dazled eyes of man. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a thriving way in prayer, not only to put up deſires to God, to perſwade him, but to gather arguments whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our own faith in the hope of ſpeeding, which will make us both cheerful in prayer, and quiet, having done our duty; Therefore though all this exerciſe be called prayer, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. yet after a ſhort ſuite, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the Prophet makes the ſtudy of arguments of faith his chief work here, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169976:141"/>15. 2. The Church is a ſtorehouſe of experience for a time of need; ſhe hath treaſures of inſtances of what God hath done, ready to be repeated againe in a new extremity; for, the Prophet repeats here works done of old, which he lookes upon as pledges of the like in this new ſtrait. 3. Gods glorious manifeſtations of himſelfe in, and for his Church, ought to be joyned with the conſideration of his holineſſe; and his glory and ſplendor ought to ſet out his perfection in purity, that the Church may fall in love therewith, and ſtudy conformity thereto; for, appearing thus he is <hi>God the holy one.</hi> 4. The Lords glory amongſt his people may ſhine brightly in a Wilderneſſe, which will not obſcure it when he lets it out; for, all this glory ſhined in the barren deſarts of <hi>Teman,</hi> or <hi>the South,</hi> which is a part of <hi>Seir,</hi> or <hi>Edom, Obad.</hi> 9. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. <hi>Judges</hi> 5.4. and <hi>mount Paran,</hi> a place alſo neere to <hi>Seir, Gen.</hi> 14, 6. where <hi>Iſhmael</hi> dwelt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.21. and where <hi>Iſrael</hi> encamped ſhortly after they came from <hi>Sinai, Num.</hi> 10.12. and 12.16. and therefore joyned with the former, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. 5. The glory of God revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and for the Church, is not to be looked upon in a tranſient way, but ought gravely and ſeriouſly to be conſidered, till our hearts be affected and warmed with it. Therefore is <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> (no where uſed, but in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and this Chapter) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, to ſhew the weight of this matter, and how our hearts ſhould pauſe and dwell upon it, till it grow upon our hands; yea, to ſhew that a ſight of him indeed, will give our hearts ſuch a ſet, as they muſt ſtand and breath a while. 6. As the excellency of all the creatures is from God, and doth daily ſet out his glory; ſo when he is pleaſed to appear in any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manifeſtation, it doth obſcure all glory beſide, and ſet him out as onely praiſe-worthy; for, in this progreſs, <hi>His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praiſe</hi> in a ſingular way, beſide what ordinarily appeareth of his glory in theſe, which this diſpenſation did in a ſort obſcure and tranſcend. 7. We ought to commend the infinite wiſdom of God and his tender reſpect to fraile man, that he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen fit means and inſtruments of Miniſters and Ordinances, whereby to make himſelf known as we are able to bear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that immediate manifeſtaſtion of him who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in light inacceſſible, would but undoe us, while we are in our mortal bodies; for, when he appeared, <hi>his brightneſſe was as the light</hi> filling heaven and earth, as if it had been all
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:169976:142"/>a ſun; This was acknowledged by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they could not endure this glory, nor hear God ſpeak, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16. &amp; 20.18, 19. And by <hi>Eliah,</hi> in wrapping his face in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, when God appeared to him. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19.13.18. The Lords moſt glorious manifeſtations of himſelf to mortal creatures, are but as vailes caſt over his infinitly glorious eſſence, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and ſo to ſay, an obſcuring of himſelf, that he may reveale himſelf to their capacity; yea, it much commends the glory of God, and may help our faith if we conſider that the moſt glorious effects of his power are but as a vaile caſt over his glorious omnipotency, who can do far above what we ask or conceive; for, <hi>he had hornes come out of his hands,</hi> or glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manifeſtations of his power ſhining in theſe glorious rayes, wherewith he arrayed himſelf on every ſide, and yet <hi>there was the hiding of his power.</hi> 9. The Lords taking his Church by the hand, when ſhe came out from the pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with her in a Covenant of marriage, and that in ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate, as teſtified what eſtimation he had of her, and what reſpect he would put upon her, gives warrant to the Church in all ages, to believe, that the glorious Lord will not deſpiſe her in her low eſtate, but notwithſtanding his great Majeſty, and her baſeneſſe, he will appear for her, will deliver her out of trouble, will let out tokens of favour to her, by which he will put reſpect upon her, and will renue his covenant with her; Therefore the Prophet by faith looks to all this as forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming for the Church in her ſecond captivity.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169976:142"/>of theſe plagues, as being moſt devouring, other plagues are not to be excluded, but underſtood. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The glory of the Lord doth ſhine, and is to be ſeen and adored in his works of judgement, as well as in other acts; for, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brings it in here, to ſet out his glory, that <hi>before him went the Peſtilence,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It is a farther manifeſtation of Gods glory, and ought to be a ground of the Churches faith, that he can and will when he pleaſeth, find wayes to plague enemies, though ſecond cauſes and probable meanes faile; ſo doth the Prophet reckon while he brings in <hi>Peſtilence and burning coales,</hi> as ready to do that work. 3. It is a part of our duty in glorifying God, to acknowledge all afflictions to be as his pages, ready to come and go at his command, that ſo our eyes may be moſt on him under them; for, ſo doth the prophet ſet out his glory, that theſe plagues <hi>went before him, and forth at his feet,</hi> attending on his progreſſe. 4. Faith may ſafely gather from judgements executed for ſinnes of old, that judgement ſhall be executed for the ſame ſinnes againe committed; and from judgements inflicted on the Church when ſhe ſinnes, that undoubtedly the ſinnes of enemies will not be paſt over; Therefore the Prophet recordeth what had been done on <hi>Egypt</hi> and themſelves, as a certain pledge of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> ruine, that the Church may be delivered.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169976:143"/>hilly country, whoſe poſſeſſion had been ancient and of old, (as the hills which they poſſeſſed) and whoſe ſtable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like the hills alſo, did promiſe them a perpetuity. And no wonder; for his wayes and purpoſes concerning his people, <hi>Deut</hi> 32, 8. were more ancient then their poſſeſſion; and God being eternal, and ſtil the ſame, will yet be forth-comming in the like need. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God who is the ſoveraign King of all Nations, and who caſts down, and lifts up whom he pleaſeth, will manifeſt himſelfe in carving out, even the outward lot and condition of his people, according to the tenour of his Covenant with them for that purpoſe; for ſo he proved <hi>when he ſtood and meaſured the earth,</hi> or <hi>the Land</hi> to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom he had promiſed it, and ſo made them hold it by the ſure tenour of his free gift. And ſo doth the Prophet expect the Lord will do yet. 2. It is a notable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to faith, and ſets out Gods glory, that look what is moſt difficult in mens ſight, and may redact them to greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, yet is moſt eaſie to God, when he puts hand to it; for <hi>he ſtood</hi> of old and deſigned a Land; he but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and drave aſunder the Nations;</hi> and albeit their poſſeſſion was neer as ancient, and appeared as ſtable as the <hi>everlaſting mountains and perpetual hills,</hi> yet they were <hi>ſcattered and did bow.</hi> 3. The Lords eminent appearing in bringing about a mercy for his people, according to the tenor of the Covenant, gives a ground of claime, when it comes in hazzard againe, and is a pledge that God will aſſert and maintaine his own glorious purchaſe, though for a time it ſeeme to bee plucked out of his hand; for, ſo would the Prophet gather, that the Lord who had not onely promiſed, but gloriouſly put his people in poſſeſſion of that land, would bring them back to it againe in due time. And to this purpoſe doth <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> alſo reaſon, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.11. 4. Albeit that mens ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long and firme-like poſſeſſion of what is the Churches right, may be great trial of faith, yet the ſtudy of Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature, and his eternal and irreſiſtible purpoſes will ſtrongly ſupport faith; Therefore the Prophet, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> power, and long poſſeſſion. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 49.24. holdeth forth Gods eternal purpoſes concerming the Church, which as of old they had overturned the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> ſo yet they would take place in all generations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. In both theſe reſpects <hi>his wayes are everlaſting,</hi> as being more ancient and ſure then the <hi>Cananites</hi> poſſeſſion, and yet the ſame unchageably to overturne the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi>

                  <p>A fourth inſtance of this glory ſhined in the terror which Gods preſence among his people, put upon their enemies, and all round about, inſtanced in theſe of <hi>Cuſhan</hi> and <hi>Midian,</hi> whoſe habitation was in tents and under curtains; This was accompliſhed, partly when in <hi>Iſraels</hi> march through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, all theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> (deſcended of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> on the other ſide of the red ſea) and <hi>Midianites,</hi> who lived thereabout were affrighted, as not knowing on whom they would fall; which feare alſo took hold on other Nations, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.14, 15. <hi>Num.</hi> 22.3, 4. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.9, 10.11. and pur them in great affliction and terrour; and partly it was accompliſhed in that norable defeat of <hi>Cuſhan Riſhathaim, by Othniel, Judg.</hi> 3.8.9.10. and of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It ſerveth to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate Gods glory, and ſtrengthen the faith of his Church in beleeving promiſes, to conſider that God can diſcover the vanity of creatures, by making ſtout-hearted nations to tremble, that he can fight againſt men with his terrour, and can diſcover himſelf terrible in and for his Church, when ſhee is in a Wilderneſſe and low eſtate; for, this is aray of his glory and a ground of the Prophets faith, that the <hi>tents</hi> of Cuſhan <hi>were in affliction</hi> (or <hi>under vanity,</hi> which this terrour diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be in them) <hi>and the curtains of the land of</hi> Midian <hi>did tremble.</hi> 2. It is a notable way to ſtrengthen faith, when we conſider how ſatisfactorily God at any time hath made good his word, and when we ſtudy much ſuch grounds and props held out to our faith by God, till we come to a full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; for faith the Prophet, <hi>I ſaw the tents, &amp;c.</hi> that is not onely the Church (in whoſe name he ſpeaks) did at that time ſee God clearly performing his Word, and therefore ſhould not doubt in a new ſtrait; but by this practice he teacheth every beleever to look back on what Ged hath done, and ſtudy upon it, till the ſight of it afford ground of comfort in new troubles, and till they ſee ground to expect the like if need be.</p>

                  <p>A fifth inſtance of this glory ſhined forth in two very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects, of dividing the red ſea and <hi>Jordan</hi> to give way to his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3. and of making hard rocks to furniſh water to quench their thirſt, <hi>Exod</hi> 17.6. <hi>Num.</hi> 20.8, 11. The firſt of theſe is amplified from Gods great love and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appearing in it, in that when he had no quarrel againſt the ſea and rivers, yet he would trouble them, and march through them in ſtate, on his horſes and chariots of the pillar of cloud and fire (oppoſed to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariots and horſemen) for the ſafety and protection of his people, and did draw forth his weapons againſt his enemies, to prove his fidelity, and the truth of his Word, frequently repeated and confirmed by oath to the tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The ſecond is amplified from Gods liberality, in giving them water in abundance, ſo that it clave the ground, and cut it ſelf a channel, and followed them in rivers, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Variety of contrary trials and difficulties on the right hand and the left, cannot exhauſt that fulneſſe of ſufficiency and love that is in God toward his people; for, if <hi>ſeas and rivers</hi> trouble them, then he can turn them into dry land, and make a way therein for them to paſſe through: If againe, want of water trouble them, he can makrocks furniſh and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it. 2. It is a point of ſpiritual wiſdom to read and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Gods minde and ſcope in his works, and what his thoughts are toward the creatures he works upon or about, that ſo none may miſtake or ſtumble, and that his people may more diſtinctly read his love to them; therefore is a queſtion (which includes a denial) thrice propounded, that none might be ſo fooliſh as to think that his dealing ſpake any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt theſe creatures, but rather proclaimed his love to his people. 3. Gods great anger againſt wicked men, ſinfully troubling his people, may appear from conſidering his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169976:144"/>with inſenſible creatures (who are not properly objects of Gods anger, as having never ſinned; but onely accidentally; when God troubles them for the good of his people, or plagues ſinners by ſmiting them) when in their ordinary courſe they ſtand in the way of his peoples well-being; for thus would the Prophet have the Church to gather, that not onely if he divided ſeas and rivers, he may do the like again, if need be; but if the Lord did ſo make the ſea and rivers to reele, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he had no quarrel, what wil he do to them againſt whom he is juſtly angry? 4. God can eaſily appear in great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, when his Church is at a low ebbe; and when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, any thing will bring ſafety; and in his Churches great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrait he will get arms to reach his enemies a ſad blow; The troubles of the Church may be full of proofs of love, and even in her loweſt condition the Lord can plague his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; for, at the red ſea, the clouds were his <hi>horſes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of ſalvation,</hi> and there <hi>his bowe was made quite naked,</hi> or his power manifeſted (as in thoſe countreys they drew their bowes out of caſes (wherein they were kept) when they went to battel) to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> overthrow. 5. The people of God do never look rightly on his works, but when thereby their hearts are warmed toward him; and ſtudying of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is one meanes appointed for ſtirring up of affection; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both here and afterward, the Prophet who formerly ſpake of God, is driven to ſpeak to God of his own working: <hi>Thou didſt ride, thy how was made naked, &amp;c.</hi> 6. The Lord ſtands bound to his people and to every one of them, conjunctly and ſeverally, by his word confirmed by oath, to doe for them what they need, and is for their good; for here is the <hi>oath of the tribes</hi> (made to them by God) <hi>even thy Word.</hi> 7. It is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table confirmation to faith, that in hardeſt times, and greateſt extremities, God will not erre in his Word, but will make it good by performance; for in this doth the Prophet incourage himſelf, that even at the red ſea, where <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought he had <hi>Iſrael</hi> encloſed, even there the Lords <hi>how was made quite naked according to the oathes of the tribes, &amp;c.</hi> 8. It is the duty of the godly, ſeriouſly to remarke every accompſiſhment of Gods Word, that it may be matter of praiſe, and clearer ground of future confidence, and relying upon his word; Therefore is <hi>Selah</hi> again ſubjoyned to this paſſage. 9. Gods people will not want refreſhment in a wilderneſſe, and that in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and God will ſupply their wants, though every thing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169976:145"/>ſhould promiſe the contrary; for, God did cleave <hi>the earth with rivers,</hi> when there were nothing but flints in a drie Wilderneſſe to bring it out of.</p>

As the brutiſhneſs of men, who do not ſtand in aw of God, may be read from mountains, and ſeas, their trembling and doing homage to him, when he puts them to it: ſo alſo the vanity of all oppoſition to Gods ſaving of his people, may be ſeen in what God did to any of theſe creatures, when they ſtood in his way; for, this is held out in <hi>the mountains ſeeing him, and trembling,</hi> in <hi>that the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the water paſſed by, the deep uttered his voice, &amp;c.</hi>

And he illuſtrates yet farther the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God ſhining in it, from ſeveral inſtances. The firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is taken from Gods making the Sunne, and Moon to ſerve his people in their warres, and contrary to their courſe to ſtand ſtill in heaven, and ſo to order their motions, as they might give time and light to the Church, to employ their weapons, and might attend and bare witneſſe to Gods fighting for his Church with haile ſtones as with arrows and ſpears, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13. which are called <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glittering,</hi> becauſe of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand in them, putting a ſplend or upon them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Sunne ſhining upon the haile ſtones, as they fell made them to glitter. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1, Albeit the people of God ſeem to be low and baſe things, in reſpect of many glorious creatures which God hath made, and ſet in ſituation above them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ordinarily they get but the common uſe of creatures, with the reſt of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. yet theſe ſingular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations do prove that all the creatures are in a ſpecial way ſervants to Saints, and that the Sunne is as a candle, to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or put out, when God ſeeth fit, as their affaires require, without any reſpect to the world beſide; for the Sun and Moon <hi>ſtood ſtill,</hi> and went as God and his people had to do. This may teach the godly to read more eſpecial love in the ordinary uſe of theſe benefits, then is let out to others. 2. Enemies to the Church may expect, that the Heaven and Earth, and all the creatures will be againſt them; and when means, or ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on earth cannot overtake them, that Heaven wil reach them, for, <hi>the Sunne and the Moon ſtood ſtill,</hi> to behold and give light to the execution made upon them; and when <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not reach them in their flight, God overtakes them with <hi>arows and a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſpear.</hi>

In his deſign in all theſe works, which was to bring ſalvation to his people by his anointed inſtruments, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Joſhua, David, &amp;c.</hi> as types of Chriſt, and of eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him. 2. In the remarkable judgements inflicted upon enemies, in that he did deſtroy the heads and rulers of thoſe wicked ſocieties, as was verified on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and other Kings (who troubled them after they were ſetled in the land) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew not only the Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but all the Soveraignty, and power that was in that land and oppoſed Iſraels poſſeſſion; yea further, he not onely cut off the the head of ſoveraignty, in the perſons of rulers; but rooted them out in their ſubjects, by
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169976:146"/>overturning ignominiouſly their ſtable condition, as a houſe when it razed from the top to the foundation, or as a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which ſupports the head) when it is made bare from the heel (which is the foundation he ſtands on) to the neck, and by cutting off their ſoveraignty, not only in Cities, but even in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour villages, and the rulers thereof; And this he did even by theſe ſame means, which they employed againſt the Church: this was accompliſhed in the ſad ſtroaks that befel <hi>Egypt,</hi> with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> eſpecially at the red ſea; in the ſtroaks that many times came upon the ſubjects of <hi>Iſraels</hi> oppreſſors, and the invaſions, and conqueſts made of their territories, under <hi>David</hi> and others, but eſpecially in the entire conqueſt of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the people were not only ſubdued, and put under the power of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the very root of the Heathens Soveraignty over that land was rooted up, by the utter extirpation of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in cities and villages (except the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and ſuch as they ſinſuily ſpared) that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might poſſeſſe their habitation. 3. Gods glory ſhined in theſe works, in fruſtrating the proud hopes of enemies; for the Lord did thus deſtroy them, when they were both violent, and confident of victory, and when they thought to overwhelm the weak Church, as with a tempeſt and made it their delight by craft and cruelty to devour her. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Unto ſuch as are the Lords people, ſalvation is his ſcope, and will be the reſult of all his enterpriſes; for it is twice mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>he went forth for the ſalvation of his people.</hi> 2. Chriſt is the ground of all ſalvation to his people, &amp; every deliverance they get is a pledge of eternal ſalvation by him; for he <hi>went forth for ſalvation with his anointed.</hi> Theſe fitted inſtruments (whom the Church will never want in her need) were but types of Chriſt, and imployed by him from whom all ſafety cometh, and theſe deliverances were ſhadows of his ſaving to the uttermoſt thoſe that come to God through him. And although the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was in a peculiar way typical, yet the godly in all times may look on temporal mercies, as pledges of better. 3. As in wicked Nations or combinations thoſe who are chiefe in authority, are ordinarily moſt eminent and inſtrumental in evil: ſo the Lord will break the combination, by cutting off thoſe which no greatneſs nor eminence ſhal be able to avert; for <hi>Thou woundeaſt the head out of the houſe of the wicked.</hi> 4. As wicked States and Nations adding oppoſition to the Church to all their other wickedneſſe, do deſerve that God ſhould root but ſuch States and Nations, by utter extirpation: ſo the Lord
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169976:147"/>hath given proof that he is able, and will not ſpare ſo to doe when he ſeeth it fit, and when his peoples need calls for it; for <hi>he diſcovered the foundation to the neck, and did ſtrike through the head of his villages.</hi> 5. The Lord will doe that in due time to his implacable enemies, which may afford matter of ſerious thoughts to themſelves and others, and ſuch diſpenſations of his are wiſely to be conſidered; therefore <hi>Selah</hi> is againe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to this purpoſe. 6. When the Lord hath enemies great and ſmal to root out, he need no other means but their own weapons, or the very deſignes whereby they think to thrive beſt, and to ruine the Church; for <hi>Thou didſt ſtrike through with his ſtaves, the head of his villages;</hi> This was the iſſue of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> purſuing <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the red ſea, of all the <hi>Canaanites</hi> enterpriſes againſt them, and was more clearly verified on the <hi>Midianites, Judg.</hi> 7.22. on the enemies of <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> dayes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.22.23. and others. 7. As the Church hath ſtill been exerciſed with violent cruel and unſatiable enemies, and muſt ſtill expect to meet with ſuch, ſo the Lord will repay this, and that even when their hopes and earneſtneſſe to carry their deſignes are greateſt; for it was both a cauſe of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the time of it, when <hi>they came out as a whirlewinde to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet in the name of the Church,) or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to overrunne her, and deſtroy her, and when <hi>their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was to devour the poor ſecretly,</hi> or <hi>in ſecret and hiddden places:</hi> that is, they took pleaſure not only to overthrow them with great Armies coming like a tempeſt upon them, but alſo to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them with ſudden incurſions when they were exhauſted and had fled to ſecret holes for ſhelter and refuge. This doth well agree with the condition of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Midian, Judg.</hi> 6 2, 3, &amp;c. under the tyranny of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. &amp; 14. and at divers other times, as at the red ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.9, 10. and when the <hi>Canaanites</hi> made head againſt them, &amp;c. 8. The Church of God in all ages is as one body and ſociety, having intereſt in the ſame priviledges, communion in the ſame faith, and the latter ages being heirs of the ſufferings of the former, and of the advantages to be reaped by them, therefore ſaith <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in the name of the Church, <hi>They came out to ſcatter me;</hi> as if the Church in his time, in the ſame individual perſons had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former trials, becauſe they were heirs to any benefit, or experience that might be gathered from them:</p>

Albeit in a time of eaſe we are ready to ſatisfie our ſelves with a tender view of Gods workes, yet a time of trouble will put us to ſtudy them over and over againe, to ſee what we can finde in them for our relief, and though many times we finde little in his works, yet when we ſtudy well, we will find that we dwell never enough on them, and that the oftner we ſtudy them, we will finde the more in them; particularly extraordinary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies would be much and often remembred: ſo much doth the Prophets practice in looking over again on this act, which was an extraordinary work, teach us. 2. It is worthy our ſecond and ſerious thoughts, both for ſetting out of Gods honour, and for confirming our faith, to conſider that Gods people are ſo dear to him, as he will turn the world upſide down, and change the courſe of nature, if need be, before they periſh; and that he can make his people go ſafely, and like conquerors, through great afflictions &amp; dangers, for ſo much doth the repeating of this act of Gods power, in making ſeas a way, and riding with his people through it, as if they had been guarded with an army, teach us.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169976:148"/>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.11.) did beat, and ſhake for fear, which made his mouth and lips to ſhiver, ſo that he could not ſpeak; though his body even to his bones, was conſumed with thoughts about it, yea, though he trembled in himſelf, as in a total diſtemper, ſo that nothing he could do, was able to bear it down, or in <hi>his place,</hi> ſo that through trembling he could neither ſit, nor ſtand, nor reſt in any place; yet he reckons by faith, that God by this exerciſe, would make that ſore day of trouble more eaſie, when it came, and when God ſhould ſend the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> againſt that rebellious people, to cut them off. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Much uſe of faith makes eaſie and comfortable work in prayer; for ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet after this ſtudy and meditation, carveth his own anſwer, and glorieth. 2. As the Lord in his long ſuffering, uſes to give faire warning to his Church before he ſtrike, if we would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from his Word; and as he uſeth to ſtrike ſore when his Church abuſeth his patience, and puts him to it: ſo his Word of threatning ought to be believed, and our faith of it ought to appear, in our deep ſenſe; and trembling becauſe of his rod ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenat us; for here is a voice of invading, or cutting in pieces <hi>with troups,</hi> ſounding againſt the Church, before it was inflicted; and this the Prophet <hi>heard,</hi> and believing it, it makes <hi>his belly tremble,</hi> &amp;c. 3. It is Gods way with his people, to humble them by trouble, and to lay them and their ſtrength of every kinde by, before they get a right way of bearing it; and it is their great valour to renounce their own ability, that they may leane on him; for the Prophet ſpeaks of himſelf, as one ſpent with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the burden, <hi>my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice; rottenneſſe entered into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelfe.</hi> 4. The Lord never puts his people to any ſore exerciſe, or trial that is ſingular, but he hath a purpoſe of good in it; and will diſcover that they are not behinde with others who ſit idle, when they are kept buſie; for in all this exerciſe of the Prophet, when others of the Jewes were ſleeping, the Lord aimed at reſt <hi>in a day of trouble;</hi> when othes ſhould be terrified with the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 5. As the Lord ſometimes begins at his own houſe with trouble, whereby they are exempted from the dregs of the cup which the wicked drink out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.12.13. ſo the Lords exerciſing and humbling of his people with the apprehenſion of approaching trouble, is a preſage &amp; a means of making it eaſie when it cometh; for hereby they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and not ſurpriſed with ſinners and hypocrites, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. they are made to ſee Gods juſtice in his ſtroak, that they dare

                  <p>The Prophet by faith aſcends yet higher, to grapple with the trouble it ſelfe; and though all creature-comforts, and means of ſubſiſtence under trouble ſhould faile, (as if means of liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from trees, land, or cattel were cut off from man, as uſeth to be in a general deſolation by war) yet he undertaketh to bear out, and to rejoyce in God for the hope of ſalvation and deliverance, by vertue of the covenant, and that intereſt the Church hath in him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the calamities of war and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity are very great and ſore; ſo it is the Lords way in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches trouble, to blaſt and lay aſide all matter of confidence in any thing beneath God; for this is no idle or impoſſible ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but what the Church may expect in her afflictions, that <hi>the figtree ſhall not bloſſom,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Faith never gets right footing or exerciſe, ſo long as the believer would ſet bounds and limits to trouble, that it may come hitherto and no farther, and doth not ſee through and condeſcend &amp; ſubmit to the worſt that poſſibly may come; for thus the Prophet ſuppoſeth, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of nature for mans preſervation may faile, to the end he may caſt himſelf wholly and cleanly upon God. 3. As the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed mercies of the Church, are ſurer then the very courſe of nature, ſo faith apprehending theſe promiſes, will out-live the worſt of ſtormes without fainting; for <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, yet will I rejoyee in the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169976:149"/>in the name of the Church. 4. Faith in hard times gets ſure footing, when it conſidereth that God who is omnipotent and alſufficient, liveth whatever come or go; and that it is ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual for God to give deliverance, according to the Covenant, when all means faile; and for Saints to get it in ſuch away, and at ſuch a time, and not before, as God hath this as a title, whereby he is known in his Church: for ſo doth the Prophets faith fix on <hi>Jehovah, the God of our ſalvation.</hi> 5. Faith is given in hard times, not onely for bearing up, but to furniſh matter of joy and gloriation, which ſhould be endeavoured after, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, as evidencing that we got more in him then trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can take from us, as being a means to make trouble eaſie; by avoiding the extremity of diſcouragement to which it drives us and a teſtimony that we expect good by trouble, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is without the reach of it; therefore the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth to <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> in the midſt of his calamity.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet by faith ſpeaks out poſitively, what he expects from God as the matter of his joy, in reference both to ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, during the time of the captivity, and to iſſue from it, to wit, that God would be the Churches ſtrength when all means failed, that he would gather and bring them back after ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and make them nimble to overcome all difficulties in their way, (as a Hind skips over mountains and inacceſſible places,) till they come to poſſeſſe their own country again, which was for the moſt part hilly, and to enjoy communion with God in the Temple, which was ſituate upon the holy mountains, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 87.1. and the Prophet to avow this his confidence, and edifie the Church, giveth out this exerciſe to be publickly ſung by the Muſicians of the Temple, and plaid upon fit inſtruments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by him, and therefore called his. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a ſingular proofe of love, and ought to be the matter of joy to the afflicted Church, when ſhe is ſupported and kept from fainting under her trouble, although ſhe have no more; for, here the Prophet ioyeth in that he hath <hi>ſtrength.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169976:149"/>2. When all props and grounds of encouragement on Earth do faile, there is abundance of furniture to ſupport Gods people and make them ſubſiſt, do or ſuffer, as he calls them, which will be forth-comming for the ſelf-denyed who wait on God; for of doth the ſelf-denied Prophet reckon: <hi>Jehovah the Lord is my ſtrength,</hi> See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.29, 30, 31. 3. The Lords people are not utterly undone and paſt hope, even when they are brought into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity out of their own land, and under the power of others; for, the Lord can return their captivity, as here the Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. 4. The promiſes of the Lord are ſo certainly to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as every promiſe of a mercy is alſo an undertaking for the removal of every impediment that may ſtand in the way of it: <hi>He will make my feet like Hindes feet,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me over all impediments, and <hi>make me to walke upon my high places.</hi> 5. Though Gods mercies be oft-times little thought of when they are enjoyed, yet the want of them will diſcover how rich they were, and make the reſtitution of them ſweet; and to the godly man, enjoynment of God in his ordinances, is far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any lot beſide; therefore doth the Prophet call the land and mountain of the Temple, <hi>mine high places;</hi> to ſhew, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it was a hilly land, in compariſon of pleaſant <hi>Babel,</hi> yet it was his choice above all the world beſide, that it ſhould be ſweet to be reſtored to it again with liberty. 6. Albeit faith may be oft-times conjoyned with much fear, that the believer may be afterward aſhamed, if he utter any thing of his confidence; yet what faith gathers from the Word, may be boldly avowed; ſo doth the Prophet avow his exerciſe, and make it publick: <hi>To the chiefe Singer, &amp;c.</hi> 7. Faith having in an hard time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended God for ſtrength and a bleſſed iſſue ought to ſtir up to praiſe in hope, in the midſt of the trouble: therefore the Prophet directs this to be ſung: <hi>To the chiefe Singer on my ſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Inſtruments.</hi>

Though the perſons of men adde nothing to a divine meſſage, but God can employ the meaneſt, and make them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable by employing them; yet ſometime it pleaſeth him to make choice of men of eminency, to clear that it is the honour of the greateſt to be his Ambaſſadours to his people, &amp; yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make them inexcuſable who contemn his meſſage for the meanneſſe of the meſſenger; therefore he employeth this Prophet, <hi>Zephaniah the ſonne of Cuſhi, the ſonne of Gedaliah, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe Parents in many generations had been of eminent note amongſt that people, and conſequently himſelf famous for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent and pedigree. 2. People through long obduration in ſin, may come to that height, as no endeavours of pious rulers will bring them to repentance, whereby they might prevent ſad threatnings &amp; judgments; for, this word of ſad denunciations

In a time of general and continued defection, the Lords long-ſuffering is ſo great, as to multiply meſſengers and warnings before he ſtrike, that ſo men may be reclaimed, or made inexcuſable; for this end was the Prophet ſent out with many others about the time of the approaching captivity, See 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.15, 16.4, As the divine authority of God is alwayes to be ſtudied, and ſeen in meſſages in the mouth of his ſervants; ſo eſpecially when the Word ſpeaks ſad things, it is good to ſee God our party, and how little cauſe we have to fix on meſſengers or their humours as the cauſe of ſuch unpleaſing doctrine, therefore, when the Prophet brings out this meſſage, it is avowed and held out to be <hi>the Word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord begins here as with a cloſed proceſſe, that needs no more but to pronounce the ſentence: and therefore, this people having been abundantly warned and convinced by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophets, he threatens them with a general deſolation of the land, by the deſtruction and taking away of all things in it, not only of men who had ſinned, but of the creatures which they had abuſed to ſatisfie their luſts, inſomuch as the beaſts ſhould be cut off and deſtroyed; yea, the very fowles ſhould be driven away, and the fiſh exhauſted from their ponds, lakes, or rivers, as it is uſual in countries infeſted with wars. By which judgment the Lord threatens to make ſhort work with the ſinner, &amp; his abuſed riches, or his Idolatry, which no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation could purge from him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords ſpirit will not alwayes ſtrive with his ſinful people, but will at laſt give out his ſentence, according to their ways; ſo much doth this abrupt falling on threatning, without any previous dealing, import. 2. A publike reformation, never ſo piouſly intended, and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly proſecuted by Rulers, after much defection, will be ſo
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169976:151"/>far from keeping off wrath, when the people are not cordial and thorough in the reformation; as by the contrary, it may ripen a people faſter for a ſtroak; for, though <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a pious and approved reformer; yet conſidering that the people did but diſſemble in the matter, and dally with God, as is marked, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.6, 10. and appeared ſuddenly upon <hi>Joſiahs</hi> death, in that in three moneths they went all wrong with the ſucceeding King, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.31, 32. therefore the Lord gives them up as deſperate; and begins, <hi>I will utterly conſume all things, &amp;c.</hi> 3. When men will not read the greatneſſe and dreadfulneſſe of divine diſpleaſure againſt them, from the greatneſſe of their ſin, or from the threatnings of the Word, it is righteous with God to write it in legible characters of extreame deſolation, as here he threatens to do to this incorrigible people, by <hi>utterly conſuming all things from off the land, man and beaſt, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man is a great burden to the Creation, in his abuſing of the creatures to fight againſt God with them, and provoking God againſt them, not for any fault of their own, but that he may puniſh man, for whoſe uſe they were created, by ſmiting them; for, <hi>Judahs</hi> ſins make <hi>all things be utterly conſumed from off the land,</hi> and bring ſtroaks on <hi>beaſts, fowles of the heaven, and fiſhes of the ſea,</hi> where by the <hi>ſea,</hi> we may underſtand any gathering of waters, in ponds, rivers, or lakes; for, in Scripture the very Laver in the Temple is called <hi>A Sea,</hi> becauſe it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much water, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.23. ſo alſo the lake of <hi>Generazeth</hi> and <hi>Tiberius, Matth.</hi> 8.24.27. <hi>John</hi> 6.1. See for this doctrine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.25, and 12.4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.3. 5. As wicked mens proſperity proveth the neck break of their ſouls, by their abuſing of it, and hardening themſelves in ſin thereby; and as Idolatry will certainty end in the eternal ruine of the impenitent Idolater: ſo theſe ſins are oft-times ſo rooted in the heart and eſtimation of ſinners, that there is no ceaſing to ſin that way, till the ſinner ceaſe to be; and in this caſe, the Lord will not ſpare, ſeeing there is no remedy; ſo here, after that reformation had eſſayed them in vain, either as to removing their Idols from them, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to ceaſe from abuſing the creatures to ſin, (in which caſe they are <hi>ſtumbling blocks,</hi> as well as Idols) God threatens to cut off <hi>the ſtumbling blocks with the wicked,</hi> and ſo put an end to their ſin by deſtroying themſelves. 6. In a time of general calamity on all the creatures, man is bound to look upon himſelfe as the chiefe and only Delinquent, and to ſee the controverſie purſuing him; therefore is he twice pointed at

                  <p>The Lord proceeds to declare more particularly upon whom this deſolation was to come, to wit, upon <hi>Judah,</hi> which was the head of thoſe that were left after the captivity of the ten tribes, &amp; particularly upon the chief City <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and he cleareth up the cauſes of this ſentence, by pointing at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſorts of ſinners whom he would cut off. Theſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in ſeveral kinds, eſpecially againſt the firſt Table of the Law, As, 1. Groſſe Idolaters of all ſorts: as theſe, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> reformation, ſtill held up ſome remnant of <hi>Baals</hi> worſhip (which was an Idol of the <hi>Zidonians,</hi> the worſhip whereof was of old followed by <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the dayes of the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; after that was brought into <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Jezebel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.31. and from thence it came into <hi>Judah.</hi>) Theſe the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to cut off, together with the Miniſters of <hi>Baal,</hi> both Chema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rims, (who are mentioned alſo, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.5, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.5. in the original; and ſeem to have been ſome inferour order of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders on the Idol, much reſembling Monks in Popery,) and Prieſts of a ſuperiour order. As alſo he threatens to cut off ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Idolaters, who imagining a Deity in the ſtars and planets, becauſe of their ſplendor or influences, did worſhip them on the tops of their houſes, (which were flat in thoſe countries,) as intending to do them homage in their own view, 1. Such as halted betwixt God &amp; Idols, who made a profeſſion of worſhipping the true God, (a part of whoſe worſhip is ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by his name,) or having ſworn obedience to God in that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169976:152"/>Covenant renewed by <hi>Joſiah,</hi> yet did mixe his worſhip with the ſervice of Idols, &amp; particularly of <hi>Malcham,</hi> or <hi>Molech,</hi> the Idol of the Ammonites, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.7. 3. Apoſtates who after their vowes and Covenant, and begun reformation, had fallen back from God to Idols. 4. Atheiſts, who had no reſpect to God nor his worſhip, whether they followed Idols or not. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No former ſtroak inflicted upon the Church, and no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will exempt impenitent ſinners, but if they goe on in their way, the laſt ſtroak will be ſoreſt; for, though <hi>Judah</hi> was not only left of all the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had God dwelling in the midſt of her, yet the Lord will plague <hi>Judah, and all the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem,</hi> and that not in an ordinary way, but will <hi>ſtreth out his hand upon them,</hi> which imports a ſtroak beyond ordinary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.20. and 7.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4, 34. even that which is mentioned here, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. 2. When the Lord plagueth a land, the controverſie muſt be of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, leaſt we miſcarry in taking it up; therefore when the Lord threatens to ſtrike, he alſo cleareth wherefore it is. 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit common calamities comes indifferently upon all, &amp; albeit the godly who ſtudy to keep their garments, ought to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in ſuch a time, and to renew their peace with God; yet it is ground of comfort to them, that the ſtroak is not principally for their cauſe, nor the wrath purſuing them; therefore the Lord enumerates the groſſe ſinners, who are his party, that the godly (whatever their lot were) might ſee their names out of that roll. 4. Mens hearts are naturally ſo beſotted &amp; addicted to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as it is hard to get a thorough reformation of it, where once it hath place: and God is ſo jealous of his glory, as for the leaſt tranſgreſſion of this kinde, he may juſtly deſtroy a land; for here, after <hi>Joſiahs</hi> reformation, there is <hi>the remnant of Baal, Chemarims and Prieſts, and they who worſhip the hoſt of heaven,</hi> for which he will conſume all things that he may <hi>cut them off.</hi> 5. It is too uſual for men, that when they ſee any excellency in the creatures, or finde any advantage by them, their hearts doat on them, and are drawn from God by them; for, upon theſe grounds did they <hi>worſhip the hoſte of heaven upon the houſe tops,</hi> and many do yet doat on ſome creature or other, though that groſſe Idolatry be removed. 6. The Lord cannot endure any halting in his matters, or any mixing of true Religion and his worſhip, with creature worſhip or Idolatry, but will make that a ground of controverſie againſt a land, as well as for groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Idolatry; for, <hi>they that worſhip, and that ſwear by the Lord,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:169976:153"/>and that ſwear by Malcham,</hi> are here put in the roll to be cut off, with the <hi>remnant of Baal, and them that worſhip the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 7. Oathes are a part of divine worſhip, wherein is aſcribed unto God the glory of Omniſcience, and of power to avenge falſe ſwearers, and he is called upon for that effect, &amp; therefore are not lightly to be uſed, nor to confirme a falſhood, nor is this glory to be given to any creature to ſwear by them; for, <hi>ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the Lord,</hi> is ſubjoyned to <hi>worſhipping him,</hi> as a chief part of it. 8. Apoſtaſie from profeſſions and engagements is a land-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſin, and a great aggravation of ſin, whatſoever it be that the decliner turnes to; for, ſo theſe words alſo may be read; <hi>They ſwear to the Lord,</hi> to wit, in renewing the Covenant, and yet <hi>ſwear by Malcham;</hi> and clearly, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>they that are turned backe from the Lord,</hi> are put in the roll to be cut off. 9. As it is uſual in times of reformation, where diverſity of wayes of Religion are juſtling out one another, that there ariſe a generation of Atheiſts, who care not for God or any Religion at all; ſo ſuch are abominable, and in a day of vengeance will be ranked with the groſſeſt corrupters, as here: <hi>Thoſe that have not ſought the Lord, nor enquired for him,</hi> bringing upon the reer of them whom God will cut off.</p>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:169976:153"/>to take the ſpoil, and the beaſts and fowles to feed on their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The greatneſſe of Gods wrath againſt ſinne, is not ſoon ſeen, nor eaſily laid to heart by them who are moſt concerned; therefore, the Lord findes it neceſſary to inculcate his ſentence over &amp; over again unto them. 2 Howſoever men going on in ſin, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, readily have low thoughts of God, yet in due time he will manifeſt himſelf to be God, upon them; and as ſinners take their time of it, for walking after the imagination of their own hearts: ſo God will take his time for putting things in order: therefore is the day of vengeance called <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> wherein he will appear to be <hi>the Lord Jehovah.</hi> 3. As ſin, never ſo long forborn, and yet continued in, will at laſt bring judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neer; ſo eſpecially ſin after reformation, ripens faſt for ſpeedy judgment: for, after <hi>Joſiah</hi> had laboured in vain among them, then <hi>the day of the Lord is at hand.</hi> 4.

Such as tread under foot, or deſpiſe the blood of the Covenant, and thoſe ordinances which hold it out unto us, and are appointed as meanes of our partaking thereof, it is righteous with God to be prodigal of their blood, and deal with them as they have entertained it; for, in recompence of their ſleighting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of ſacrifices, which were types to point out, and lead them to the blood of Chriſt; <hi>The Lord hath prepared a ſacrifice, he hath bid his gueſts.</hi>

Proſperity and want of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:169976:155"/>exerciſe, by viciſſitudes of diſpenſations, its a great feeder of Atheiſme, and an enemy to the obſervation and making uſe of divine providence; and this again doth embolden and harden men yet more in their ſecure and wicked courſes; for, <hi>the men that are ſetled on their lees,</hi> are alſo the men <hi>that ſay in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he doe evil;</hi> which is both the effect of their ſecure condition, and a ground they lay down forſetling themſelves yet more in it. 3. Secure A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts and contemners of God and his providence may expect that God will refute them in a language which they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and make them know his providence upon their own experience, by effects which they ſhall not get avoided; for, the Lord will prove his Omniſcience, and care of things below by ſearching <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as with candles, that they may not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape him, and his effectual providence by puniſhing them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>their goods become a booty, and their houſes a deſolation.</hi> 4. When the Lord ſtrips a ſinful perſon or people of any mercies which they enjoyed, they will finde upon narrow ſearch, that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment thereof hath been a ſnare to them to draw them to ſin, and they ſhall read this in the ſtroak; for, <hi>Therefore,</hi> (that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things had emboldened them to <hi>ſettle on their lees,</hi> &amp; deny a providence, therefore,) <hi>their goods ſhall become a booty, &amp;c.</hi> 5. As the Lord will prove the infallible verity of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, however contemned, upon ſuch as dare run that hazard; ſo the holy juſtice of God is to be adored, in diſappointing men of any happineſſe or contentment they expected in theſe things for which they hazzard their ſouls, and ſo rendring them twice loſers, who will not ſerve him; for, here an old ſentence of the law was to be executed, wherein this juſt procedure ſhines; <hi>They ſhall alſo build houſes, but not inhabit them, &amp;c.</hi>

Though ſecure ſinners contemne all oppoſition from men, and do put the evil day far off, and think nothing of vengeance, when it is looked on at a diſtance, yet God is a terrible party againſt ſuch, and can bring evil on a ſudden, and when it is imminent, it will be ſad and dreadful; for, it is <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> that they ſhould not eye weak Prophets, or the Chaldeans only: and <hi>it is neer, and haſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A ſecond inſtance of terribleneſſe is, that in this day the wrath of an angry God ſhould be made manifeſt, by diſtreſſe and trouble on men, and waſting and deſolation on cities and countreys, and that all thoſe calamities ſhould he without any light of comfort; the clouds of their ſin, and of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rendering all things black, and diſmal-like <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lord may juſtly for ſin teſtifie wrath againſt a viſible Church, and fatherly diſpleaſure againſt his own in it; ſo that will make a judgement terrible, when his anger is ſeen and felt in it; for, that is an inſtance of the terrour of that day, that it ſhall be <hi>a day of wrath.</hi> 2. Though God teſtifie his diſpleaſure againſt ſin many wayes, yet ſuch is the ſtupidity of men, that his anger is little ſeen or laid to heart, till it appear in ſad cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; therefore is <hi>that day called a day of wrath,</hi> 3. In a time when God is purſuing a land for ſin, none are to expect caſe, but in ſome meaſure or other to be put to it, and to taſte of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169976:156"/>for, that day will be <hi>a day of trouble and diſtreſſe, a day of waſteneſſe and deſolation</hi> to perſons and places. 4. As judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted for ſin, or ſin and wrath for ſin meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will make a black repreſentation of affaires, will hold out the judgement in its ſaddeſt colours, and diſcover many clouds betwixt the ſinner and Gods countenance, ſo it is the capeſtone of a calamity, when ſpiritual comfort, or ſome favour from God is denyed, or hid under it; when he ſmites and hides himſelf, it ſpeaks wrath indeed; for, this makes the day terrible, that when all this is on, it is withal, <hi>a day of darkneſſe and gloomineſſe, a day of clouds and thick darkneſſe.</hi>

So it is a great addition to its terrour, when guilt makes men read Gods wrath in it, eſpecially when wrath from the Lord lets it not prove a falſe alarme, but makes the enemy ſo ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as nothing ſtands in his way, nor can purſued ſinners finde any place of ſafety or ſhelter; for, being <hi>a day of wrath, ver.</hi> 15. this adds to the terrour, that it is <hi>a day of the trumpet and alarm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fenced cities and high towers.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A fourth and fifth inſtance is, that the diſtreſſe ſhall be ſo great, becauſe of ſin, as to leave them deſtitute of all counſel, not knowing what to do, more then blind men know whether
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:169976:157"/>to walk; and that they ſhall be cut off with the ſword, &amp; their blood poured out in as great abundance, &amp; with as little regard as the duſt they tread upon, and their carcaſſes left like dung on the ground. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is a dreadful condition in a day of ſtrait to be void of light to direct men what to do; ſo how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever finful men truſt much to their own policy in a calm day, yet a day of wrath will overturn all their deſigns, &amp; leave them deſtitnte of counſel; for, <hi>I will bring diſtreſſe upon men, that they ſhall walke like blinde men.</hi> 2. When judgements are accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with darkneſs and perplexity, Gods hand is to be eminently ſeen in that ſtroak, and he is to be juſtified by our reading the bitter fruit of ſinne in it; for, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will bring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, that they ſhall walke like blinde men,</hi> and that becauſe <hi>they have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> 3. It is juſt with God, when he hath purſued ſinners with judgements in this life, to cut them off alſo in their iniquity, and ſend them out of the world, to receive their full reward: yea, and to teſtifie his diſpleaſure on their very dead bodies; for ſo it is threatned, <hi>their blood ſhall be poured out as duſt, and their fleſh as dung.</hi> 4. The gredineſſe and cerribleneſſe of divine wrath againſt ſin, may be read in the meaſure of a calamity, in the ignominy of a ſtroak, and in Gods not owning, nor evidencing that he pitties in affliction; for all theſe are in this ſtroak to be matter of terrour to them, <hi>their blood ſhall be poured out as duſt, and their fleſh as dung.</hi>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:169976:157"/>may be ſeen in its terribleneſſe; for, after all their imaginations that this evil day was far off, that it ſhould be light, that their fenced Cities would ſhelter them, &amp;c. which have been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red uſeleſſe in the former purpoſe, there remaineth yet their riches to be declared vaine. 2. The wrath of God purſuing ſin, is ſo dreadful, as no riches or treaſures wherein men truſt, can ward off the ſtroak, nor any thing elſe, ſave the blood of Chriſt fled unto by the ſelfe-condemned ſinner; for <hi>neither their ſilver nor their gold ſhall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lords wrath.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19. 3.

When the Lord ſpeaks in hardeſt tearmes to his ſinfúl peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet they are to read in it an invitation and allowance to come to him by repentance, and not that he is putting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from any duty of that kinde; Therefore, though the Lord had uttered his ſentence as a concluded buſineſs, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2. yet here he ſheweth what uſe they ſhould make of it, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him by repentance. 2. Repentance is not acceptably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, where there is not a thorough and harrow ſearch &amp; enquiry made into our own hearts and wayes, and an helping one of another, in our ſtations to perform that duty; that ſo our conſciences from clear conviction, may charge upon us thoſe ſins for which the Word threatens, and the ſinfulneſſe of them, and may ſtir up to turn unto the Lord; for ſo the words in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal may be rendered, <hi>ſearch narrowly into your ſelves, and ſearch,</hi> (as men do after ſtubble ſcattered here and there, as the word is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.12. or after what is loſt amongſt it) that is, ſearch, and ſearch again, &amp; while ye are thus employed about your ſelve, ſtir up and help others to ſearch; for ſo the original conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth import. 3. For ſtirring up to this duty of ſearching, and making it effectual, it is neceſſary that every man recollect his wandring thoughts, whereby he hath ſnuffed up the winde
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169976:158"/>at his pleaſure, and hunted after vanities; and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints be entertained, particularly in ſolemne and publick humiliations; for, ſo doth the Word ſignifie, according to the tranſlation, <hi>gather your ſelves together, yea, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together.</hi> See <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15, 16. 4. As this duty of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſelf-ſearching is of great importance and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all times, and caſes, and eſpecially when God declares himſelf to be angry; ſo it is a duty to the performance whereof there is need of much ſtirring up from the Lord; ſo much alſo doth the doubling of exhortations, <hi>gather, yea gather,</hi> import. 5. It is neceſſary for our humiliation, and for ſetting forth the freedome of Gods love, and how much he tendereth our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; that we know our ſelves well, and what we are, to whom the Lord gives invitations, or makes gracious offers: for this end is it declared here, that the Lord invites to repentance a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>not affected with deſire,</hi> to wit, of turning to God, or of their own good; and <hi>not deſired,</hi> or worthy to be beloved of him: the Original word will import both. 6. It is a great addition unto, and aggravation of ſin, when it is general and overſpreads a land, either by general corruption, or by rulers their connivence at ſins of particular perſons, which brings guilt upon the whole land; or by private perſons, their not mourning for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the time, which involveth them in the guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: All which alſo may contribute to commend Gods kindneſs in following ſuch a crew, and to hold forth the neceſſity of repentance, when the diſeaſe is ſo deſperate; for this cauſe it is marked, that they were, <hi>a Nation not deſired,</hi> eſpecially by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of overflowing ſin. 7. As the Lord in his long-ſuffering, doth not always execute vengeance immediately upon his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, or threatning ſo to do, but alloweth ſome time for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of that conceived birth (as the word in the original imports) ſo the Lords moſt abſolute threatnings do not ſeclude the penitent from hope, but rather invite to ſpeedy repentance; ſo are we taught here, <hi>gather your ſelves before the decree bring forth;</hi> as giving time to them to repent, and ground of hope if they ſhould ſo do; for however the Lords eternal purpoſes be unalterable, yet his threatnings (which are his pronounced decree, or ſentence according to the law) when moſt abſolutely pronounced, to exclude the exception of repentance, <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.4, 10. The Lord threatning ſo ſharply, that upon our perverting of him, he may not execute it; as, on the contrary, he promiſeth that he may fulfill. And when his threatnings do hold forth,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169976:159"/>even his irrevocable purpoſe to ſend outward land-judgements, notwithſtanding the repentance of any, as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.26.27. yet repentance before it be executed, is to good purpoſe, for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the penitent before the evil day come, as was done to <hi>Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi> for moderating it to him, if he be continued as <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the godly remnant found, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.11. &amp; for taking off wrath out of whatſoever they ſhal taſte of the cup. 8. It is an horrid iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deſpiſe the patience and long-ſuffering of God, or to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſetting up of our furnace of examination, &amp; ſelf-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he threatens, and will provoke him to ſet up his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of judgment ſo much the hotter, that it hath been long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; for, if they let <hi>the decree bring forth,</hi> and a day of patience blow over without repentance and fanning themſelves, he will make <hi>the day paſs,</hi> and drive them <hi>as chaff,</hi> and will ſend <hi>his fierce anger upon them.</hi> 9. None who do believe divine wrath, how forcible it is, and how weak themſelves are to reſiſt, but they do proclame their own madneſs, if they ſet not about repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance when God threatens; Therefore it is thrice held out, what this day will be, that <hi>it ſhall paſs as chaff,</hi> that <hi>the fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Lord, the day of the Lords anger ſhall come upon them,</hi> as ſufficient to move any who were not quite bereft of ſenſe, to <hi>gather together before the decree bring forth.</hi>

In declining times the Lord
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169976:159"/>hath a peculiar eye to the godly, and expects much from them; Therefore, leaving the wicked Nation, he turneth to them with exhortations and promiſes. 2. The truth and reality of grace will manifeſt it ſelfe in mens being of ſubdued, meek and humble ſpirits, ſtooping to the Word, abaſing themſelves, trembling under judgements, and tender towards others, and in their not giving way to diſcouragement from duty, however they be humble, but ſtirring up themſelves to ſeek God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and adorning their profeſſion with righteous converſation, reſpecting Gods commands, whatever their own natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be; Thus are the Godly deſcribed here to be <hi>ſeekers of the Lord, the meek of the earth</hi> (or <hi>of the land) which have wrought his judgment,</hi> or obeyed his righteous ordinances enjoyned to them. 3. Though it be incident to the godly to fall into ſome decay in a time of general defection, and to be diſcouraged from their duty by the evil example of others; yet the truly godly ought to prove themſelves to be ſuch by their perſeverance, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeeking more of what they already have, and of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to cover all; and eſpecially they ought to be on the growing hand, if they would beare out and finde favour in an evil time; therefore in ſuch a time is this exhortation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>ſeek ye the Lord, ſeek righteouſneſſe, ſeek meekneſſe,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of the exhortation ſhewing the neceſſity of the thing exhorted to. 4. As it is the Lords great mercy toward ſuch as fear him, that he puts the remiſſion of their ſins and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſſe out of all doubt; ſo alſo he is able, when he pleaſeth, in hardeſt dayes to give them proofes of love in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral favours by taking them into his protection, and either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them from trouble, or moderating it; for, here there is no doubt made of the firſt, and even in the ſecond it is declared poſſible, <hi>it may be ye ſhall be hid.</hi> 5. The Lord ſeeth it fit to exerciſe his deareſt children with great uncertainties what their lot may be in common calamities, not that they ſhould doubt of his power, or good wil, but that they may be ſenſible of the difficulty of the thing it ſelf, and that in ſo great &amp; overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calamities, the righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved, that ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The firſt he begins at, are the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines on their weſt ſide; wherein he firſt threatens four of their great Cities, with being made ſolitary and deſolate, with being openly and violently ſtormed, and the inhabitants led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity, when it ſhould be impoſſible to travel for heat, and with total extirpation; which judgements are expreſſed in the firſt language, with fit alluſions to the names of the Cities, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and <hi>Gath</hi> the fifth principal City of the Philiſtines, is omitted in this ſentence, either becauſe it was then in poſſeſſion of the Jews, or becauſe it is comprehended under the reſt, as <hi>Amot</hi> 1.8.

                  <p>The third denunciation is againſt the Ethiopians, who were either a Nation commonly called ſo, beyond <hi>Egypt,</hi> who had ſerved in armies employed againſt the Church, as theſe other Southern Nations were uſually employed abroad, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ezek</hi> 27.10. or rather a people in <hi>Arabia,</hi> deſcended alſo from <hi>Cuſh,</hi> and lying on the other ſide of the red ſea, over againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia</hi> commonly ſo called, who are the people uſually called <hi>Ethiopians</hi> in Scripture: theſe as they had been deſtroyed by <hi>Aſa,</hi>

Though the enemies of the Church were never ſo many on all hands, and never ſo ſar remote, yet Gods hand is enough for them all; for, here he undertakes againſt enemies on all quarters; and beſides the <hi>Philiſtines, Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens that <hi>the Ethiopians alſo</hi> (which ſoever of theſe Nations it be) <hi>ſhall be ſlain.</hi> 2. It is a ſpecial part of right reading of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſee Gods hand in them, that his quarrel may be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his love to his people in avenging their quarrel may be ſeen, that his ſoveraign power and providence over al the world may be adored, and the ſmitten may know whither to flee for an iſſue; therefore it is added, <hi>Ye ſhall be ſlain by my ſword.</hi>

Albeit that ſmful wayes and oppreſſion may for a time raiſe up men to great power and glory, and make cities and countries to flowriſh, yet ere all be done, it will lay them as low; yea, make them more deſolate then is imaginable; ſo did <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Nineveh feele;</hi> when <hi>flocks lay down in the midſt of her, all the beaſts of the Nations;</hi> when <hi>the Cormorant and Bittern did lodge in the upper lintels of it, &amp;c,</hi> And no wonder, for theſe creatures were no more monſtrous in mens account, then the former inhabitants were in Gods ſight.</p>

                  <p>The Lord having by his Prophet, uſed all the former meanes for reclaiming his people, but in vain; he comes now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his laſt ſentence againſt the body of that nation, and threatens <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a wo; the general cauſes whereof were her pollution, through oppreſſion and violence, and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of warnings from the Word, her not being bettered by corrections, her not truſting in God, but in other things, and her not entertaining communion with him, who offered himſelf to her in the Covenant. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Gods anger declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a people, portends miſery enough to them, though there were no other evidences of it; ſo he will not ſpare nor exempt his own people, when they provoke him: eſpecially ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt obliged to him, yet do prove eminent in defection; therefore as he threatens other Nations, ſo alſo his own ſinful people, and names <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for all, becauſe ſhe was chiefe in the defection, who ſhould have been holy, and a Sanctuary to God; and under this <hi>wo</hi> comprehends all the evils which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward purſued that people. 2. Injuſtice and oppreſſion is an abominable and filthy ſin, eſpecially in the Church; and the riches gathered that way, do not give any ſplendor, but make men and places vile in Gods ſight, and obnoxious to his curſe; for, <hi>the oppreſſing City is filthy and polluted,</hi> as the crop or gorge of a ravenous bird, where all unclean things are heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or as one made a publick ſpectacle of infamie, as the word imports, and therefore <hi>wo to her.</hi> 3. As diſobedience unto the Lord, revealing his mind by his word, is ground ſufficient for a quarrel; and as contempt of the authority of God in his word, is the cauſe of mens boldneſſe in ſinne: ſo it will be a great aggravation againſt ſinners, that warnings from the Word do not reclaim them: for, <hi>Wo to her that is filthy, ſhe obeyed not the voice.</hi> 4. As rods ſent upon the Church, will either make her better, by inſtructing and humbling her under Gods hand, or ripen her yet more for Gods wo: ſo obſtinacy in ſinne under corrections, is a ſad aggravation thereof: for, <hi>Wo to her that is filthy, ſhe received not correction,</hi> or inſtruction by her corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the word imports. 5. God is ſo willing to be the ſtay and confidence of his people, that it is a quarrel when they will not lean all their weight on him: and as want of faith in God drives men to ſinful and wrong courſes, ſo this is a great iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before him: for, <hi>Wo to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppreſſing City, ſhe truſted not in the Lord:</hi> and this alſo is the cauſe why the word or rod works ſo little. 6. As the neglect
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169976:166"/>of keeping communion with God, turneth the heart looſe to all ſinful wayes and ſnares; ſo the cauſe of little dependance on God in ſtraits, is, becauſe men cannot be at paines to keep neer God, that ſo they may reap the fruit of faith; for, <hi>Wo to her that is filthy, ſhe drew not neer to God, and ſhe truſted not in the Lord,</hi> becauſe ſhe could not rake paines <hi>to draw neere to God.</hi> 7. The Lords gracious condeſcendence and offering of himſelf to the viſible Church, to be approached unto in all caſes, and her profeſſion of having an intereſt in him, doth aggravate her ſault in not making uſe of him, nor taking hold of ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for it is an addition to her ſin, that <hi>ſhe drew not neer to her God;</hi> that is, to God who was hers in offer and viſible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and in whom ſhe gloried as hers.</p>

                  <p>The Lord ſubjoynes the ſins of Church-officers, as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of this judgement, and chargeth their falſe Prophets, who pretended to an extraordinary calling, with prophaneeſs and levity in their carriage, and inconſtancy in their doctrine, fitting it to all humours and parties, which was great perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and their Prieſts or ordinary Miniſters, with propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sanctuary and holy things, in miniſtring unto the Lord, and with perverting the true ſenſe of the law in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary doctrine, and teaching of the people. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When God reckons with a land for ſin, it is no ſtrange thing to ſee them who ſhould be meanes of reclaiming people, that they may flee from the wrath to come, acceſſory to the guilt of the land, and partakers in the judgement; for both Prophets and Prieſts are here found guilty; See <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.14. 2. Want of gravity in carriage, and raſhneſſe, and inconſtancy in doctrine, making the Word <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> and fitting doctrine to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, parties and times, is a character of a falſe Miniſter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to a lands ſin, and liable to ſad judgements, whatever extraordinary or ſingular thing he pretend to; <hi>Her Prophets are light,</hi> (or <hi>raſh, unſtable and heady</hi>) <hi>perſons.</hi> 3.

It is a token of ſins full ripeneſſe, and of ſpeedy approaching judgement, when Miniſters dare pollute the holy things of God, by going prophanely and in a carnal way about his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice; (their own familiarity and frequent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it, without ſenſible hearts, having bred a contempt of it) and ſo embolden others to do the like, or tempt them to abhor Gods ſervice: thus was it with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when wo came upon her; <hi>Her Prieſts have polluted the Sanctuary.</hi> 6. The holy Scripture being the revealed will of the ſupreame Lord, and the unalterable rule of mens duty, according to which they may expect bleſſings or curſes, it muſt be an high preſumption in men, to wreſt and force it to applaud their fancies, and to take their light to the Word, and father it upon it, and not come with ſubmiſſion of heart to receive light from it; and ſo make of Scripture what they pleaſe: this is alſo a quarrel, <hi>They have done violence to the Law.</hi>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a viſible Church perſevering in ſin, may bleſſe her ſelfe and expect great things from Gods viſible preſence with her; yet all theſe priviledges ſpeak the impenitent ſinners diſadvantage, &amp; their lying neer a ſtroak; for, if <hi>the juſt Lord be in the midſt thereof, he will doe no iniquity,</hi> to wit, in ſparing her being ſo ſinful. See <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2, 3. 2. God doth ſo much delight in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:169976:167"/>and is ſo tender of his people, that he never proceeds to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo long as there is another way uneſſayed to reclaim them, or to ſtint the courſe of their ſin; which doth abundantly juſtify him when he judgeth; for, in this alſo he is <hi>the juſt Lord in the midſt thereof, he will not do iniquity,</hi> in that he will not caſt off till other means be eſſayed, as the following purpoſe cleareth. 3. It is a great favour from the Lord, and a teſtimony of his long ſuffering, when he doth not take every finner at his firſt word, but followeth him with frequent warnings of his danger if he go on; and offers of advantage if he returne; for, it is marked here as an evidence of Gods kindneſſe in this proceſſe, that <hi>every morning,</hi> (which was the uſual time of Prophets, preaching, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.25.) <hi>doth he bring his judgements to light, he faileth not.</hi> 4. Albeit men may pretend to acknowledge the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God and his Word; yet it is uſual, that when they are mad on ſin, and going to ruine, this ſhould be a preſage of it, that the Word will do nothing at them; for it is marked as their ſin, and a token that judgement muſt come on, when notwithſtanding warnings; <hi>the unjuſt knoweth no ſhame.</hi> 5. None who are within the viſible Church, and doe acknowledge a Deity, and yet dare with a high hand ſin againſt the cleer light of the Word, but they proclaim themſelves to be deſtitute of all ingenuity, and given up to the plague of effronted impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for, ſuch <hi>know no ſhame.</hi>

                  <p>A ſecond evidence of their incorrigibleneſſe is, that the Lord had often-times viſited the Nations round about; not one, but many of them, and not with an ordinary, but with remarkable ſtroakes, deſtroying their ſtrong holds, or Princes, (which as corner ſtones, as the word imports, uphold the fabrick of the Common wealth) and making ſuch havocke of the Nations as there were neither traveller nor Inhabitant to be found:
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:169976:168"/>all which, conſidering out ward meanes, and their duty, might have warned them to flee thoſe ſinnes, for which thoſe Nations had been puniſhed, and inſtructed them to fear God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their wayes, that ſo their afflictions might have kept within bounds of fatherly correction, and they might have prevented the laſt ſtroake of being put out of their land: and yet for all this, they were ſo farre from turning to God, that they were even worſe, all their wayes being not only ſinful, but corrupt, and bent, active, and headlong in going wrong, as if it had been their ſtudy: and they were as earneſt to goe wrong, as he had been to reclaim them, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Church is ſo dear unto God, and he ſo tender of her well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that before he ruine her, he will preach her duty, and danger to her, upon the dear expence of others; for all theſe ſad judgements on others, <hi>v.</hi> 6. was to inform her, that ſhe might prevent the like. 2. Judgements inflicted on any of the world, is a document, and call to others to fear God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being guilty of the like ſinnes, yea, even the Church ought to take warning from judgements on enemies; for, <hi>He cut off thir Nations, laid their Towers deſolate, &amp;c.</hi> that his Church might <hi>feare him,</hi> and <hi>receive inſtruction.</hi> 3. Albeit God onely wiſe, to whom all his works are known from the beginning, cannot be diſappointed of any expectation he hath; yet this dealing with his ſinfull people, and the meanes he uſeth, are ſuch as in reaſon might promiſe, and doe indeed oblige them to bring forth the fruits of repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; therefore he ſubjoynes to this warning, from his judgements on others, <hi>I ſaid, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive inſtruction;</hi> ſpeaking after the manner of men, and ſhewing what his dealing did oblige to. 4. True godlineſſe, and an evidence of true turning from Apoſtaſie; conſiſts in an holy aw of God, and fear becauſe of our offending him, or to offend him again, joyned with ſpiritual wiſdom, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the word, and from our experience of our ſelves, and our failings, or of others, to carry on and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d that diſpoſition; for ſo is their duty here deſcribed, <hi>Thou wilt feare me, thou wilt receive inſtruction.</hi> 5. No ſtroakes on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ought to be a diſcouragement to them, being penitent, from comming to God, or from expecting good at his hand, for if they ſhould <hi>fear him, ſo their dwelling ſhould not be cut off, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he puniſhed them.</hi> 6. Albeit true godlineſſe, or turning
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:169976:168"/>to God from ſinful wayes, will not exempt a people from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſements to make them more wiſe, and their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet more ſerious; yet the penitent in theſe will meet with favour, conſidering what he deſerves, and what ſuch as go on in impenitency meet with; for ſo is inſinuated, <hi>ſo their dwelling ſhould not be cut off, howſoever I puniſhed them.</hi> 7. To be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from going into captivity, out of our own land, where we ſhould want the publick ordinances of Gods worſhip, is a mercy which may ſweeten much affliction in our own land; it is a promiſe to the penitent, <hi>Their dwelling ſhall not be cut off, howſoever I puniſhed them.</hi> 8. Such is the madneſſe of men, eſpecially where the Lord hath given them over, that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will warn them; their ſecurity, conceit, dreaming of priviledges, &amp;c. will hide all dangers from ſuch, till they light upon themſelves; for all theſe warnings wrought not, <hi>they corrupted all their doings.</hi> 9. The more meanes be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to reclaim a people, without ſucceſſe, the worſe will that people grow; where meanes are not bleſſed, they leave that curſe behinde them; therefore all theſe meanes of warnings, threatnings, promiſes, and leſſer ſtroakes being in vaine, ſee what followeth, <hi>They roſe up early, and corrupted all their doings,</hi> they were vigilant, active, and earneſt to goe wrong. 10. It is a cleare proofe of incorrigibleneſſe, and a preſage of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ruine, when a people are never more mad upon ſinne, then when judgements are let forth for it; for by this the Lord proves their incorrigibleneſſe, and ſealeth this wo upon them, that when the Nations were cut off, yet <hi>They roſe up early, and corrupted all their doings.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord having thus accuſed, and left the body of the Jewes under his wo, he turnes now to the godly among them, who could not but be affrighted with theſe threatnings, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:169976:169"/>troubled with the thoughts of diſperſion of the people; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propounds divers grounds of their encouragement, ſome whereof were to be accompliſhed in part, at their return from the captivity, and all of them ſpiritually, in the dayes of the Meſſiah, beſide what may be expected yet more fully at the converſion and ſaving of all Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ground of encouragement is, that as they had God to wait and depend upon in the time of the enſuing calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein God would conſume the Jewes out of his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie over them; ſo there was ground of hope, that the Lord having puniſhed his Church would appear againſt her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to take the prey out of their teeth, and raiſe up the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to conſume them, and make ſuch havoke of them, as might teſtifie his zeal for his people, and glory, which had been violated by them; and therefore the godly were patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expect this day, ſo much the rather as all this ſhould tend to the advance ment of the Kingdome of Chriſt, as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cleared. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords juſt controverſie againſt the viſible Church, provoking him to abandon her, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminiſh his affection to any godly remnant in it, nor make him forget them in ſad times: for in the midſt of all theſe quarrels, he hath a word to them: 2. God in his Church, is jealous of her, and of her affection toward him, and for his Church againſt all that trouble her; in both which caſes, his jealouſie being provoked, is terrible, and will raiſe up many inſtruments, and make a great deſtruction; for this <hi>jealouſie</hi> of God, firſt againſt the Jewes (which is ſuppoſed here, and firſt in order to be underſtood) and then againſt her enemies (which is moſt expreſly pointed at) will <hi>ariſe to the prey</hi> as a roaring Lyon, will <hi>aſſemble Nations and Kingdomes,</hi> to make them ſcourges to the Jews, and then to be plagued themſelves, <hi>Will pour out indignation, and fierce anger,</hi> and <hi>devour all the earth or Land.</hi> 3. When the Lord is about to bring forth ſome glorious peece of his Goſpel-work, The Church is to expect ſome great ſhakings, and vaſtations to make way for it; for in order to what followeth in this Chapter, there will be <hi>a devouring of all the earth,</hi> a caſting of all into the furnace, that he may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When it pleaſeth the Lord to let judgements upon his Church ariſe to a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and a leaving of them in their enemies hand, the godly are to expect a time of the trial of faith, and patience, before there be a change; as here is inſinuated, that when <hi>Judah</hi> is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169976:169"/>conſumed, there will be need of <hi>waiting on God,</hi> before a day of vengeance on enemies come about. 5. Times of greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, have matter of encouragement to the godly, in that they have ground of preſent dependance on God for ſtrength and furniture, during the ſtraite: and ground of future hope, that there will be an outgate, and that vengeance will come on oppreſſors: they are allowed and invited to <hi>wait on God,</hi> till that other day come. 6.

Thus a <hi>pure language</hi> ſeemes to be underſtood, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.18. not ſecluding purity of heart, amongſt ſome of them, which it evidenced by purity of language, as may appeare from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. and from what is further promiſed here; yea, the Lord promiſeth that he will gather them from the furtheſt parts of the world, to ſeek him, and offer ſervice to him, <hi>v.</hi> 10. This promiſe is accompliſhed, partly in his gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt, his diſperſed elect throughout the world, and remoteſt corners thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.52. and theſe Ethiopians, or, (as ſome conceive) Egyptians, among the reſt; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſhall be accompliſhed when the Lord ſhall call ſcattered <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the remoteſt parts of the world to ſerve him, and they ſhall bring in ſome Gentiles with them, as a gift to God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is matter of praiſe to God, and of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:169976:170"/>to the godly, that go with Nations as it will, yet he is not to want a Church, though he ſhould gather it from among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Gentiles, and ſuch as there is little apparent hope of; for when <hi>the earth is devoured,</hi> v. 8. then he will get <hi>many people,</hi> as the word is, and that <hi>from beyond the rivers of</hi> Ethiopia. 2. Purity of Doctrine, worſhip and profeſſion, is the glory of a Goſpel-Church, and a glorious work of God to make it ſo, and keep it ſo; for, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will turne to the people a pure language,</hi> or, pure Doctrine and profeſſion, inſtead of their Idolatrous and blaſphemous fancies, and their way following thereupon. 3. Purity of Doctrine, worſhip and profeſſion, doth not conſiſt in a lawleſſe liberty, or toleration, to think or ſay what men will, but is conjoyned with, and carried on by an united uniformity, which as it is the rich fruit &amp; recompence of much trouble, ſo it is to be expected in the Lords time and meaſure: for, when after their much trouble they ſhall have <hi>a pure language,</hi> they <hi>will ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> or <hi>ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> even in that <hi>pure language,</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. 4. As unanimity in the matters of God, and the free acceſſe of Jew and Gentile to ſerve God, the one as well as the other, is a great mercy of the Kingdome of Chriſt: ſo when ſeekers of God are of one heart, and do all put hand to the work to help one another, without obſtructing, or lying by, it is a token of thriving ſervice: this is alſo included in the promiſe, as a great bleſſing, and a meanes of much good, <hi>They ſhall ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> 5. The true characters of a converted and ſpiritual people, are their being much in calling on God, imploying and making uſe of him in all things, and their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up themſelves to be his ſervants at his diſpoſal; and in teſtimony of their ſubjection, and thankfulneſſe, they will put hand to his work, as they are called, will do all as ſervice to him and bring their worſhip, themſelves, or others, as they are able to offer up to him: thus are they here deſcribed, <hi>They all call on the name of the Lord,</hi> when they get the pure language, they are <hi>ſuppliants,</hi> they <hi>ſerve him,</hi> and <hi>bring his offering.</hi> 6. As the Lord will not loſe any of his elect, how farre ſoever ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through the world, and will recover his own, when their caſe ſpeakes them afarre off, and they are driven to exile, without hope or probability of returne, in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; ſo in particular, the Lord will in due time ſeek after and recover his ancient people, now of a long time ſcattered, whereby there ſhall be a reviving of his ſervice in the world;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:169976:170"/>for <hi>from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,</hi> he will ſeek <hi>the daughter of his diſperſed,</hi> and cauſe them to come, at which time there will be <hi>ſuppliants</hi> and <hi>offerings</hi> brought, and <hi>ſerving of him with one conſent.</hi>

Greateſt promiſes of outward things, will not afford matter of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the godly, unleſſe with theſe the work of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and renovation be going on; therefore is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to encourage the godly Jewes. 2. Albeit the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled people have cauſe to be aſhamed of themſelves, and to teſtifie their repentance, by bluſhing for their backſlidings, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.61. yet being reconciled and turned to God, they may lift up their face through a Mediator, expecting not to be eternally confounded, and that God will not charge them with theſe finnes, but will bury them; and make their future converſation rub off that reproach, and by his doing for them, will take away the ignominious effects of their ſinne; ſo much doth this promiſe aſſure us. <hi>In that day ſhalt thou not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:169976:171"/>for all thy doings, wherein thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> 3. As men cannot prove their ſinne to be really par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but by their renewed converſation; ſo without this there is no taking away of the ignominy of former ſinful wayes; thus doth the Lord prove that they ſhall be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned people, and not aſhamed, <hi>for then I will take away out of the midſt of thee, them that rejoyce in thy pride, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The ſhameful ſinne of the viſible Church, is her boaſting of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal priviledges, and being bold to ſinne, becauſe of them, her outward mercies of that kinde becomming her ſnare, and ſtanding betwixt her and the kernel of them; for this is the ſinne to be removed; <hi>rejoycing in thy pride,</hi> or, <hi>excellency,</hi> as the word ſignifieth, and <hi>being haughty becauſe of my holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> 5. As the Lord muſt be the worker of our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and renovation, as his making a promiſe about it doth teach us; ſo when the Lord hath a minde to do good, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for a people, who have lain under great ignominy and judgements for ſinne, he can ſoone reforme them, and make them ſhine in holineſſe, as here he promiſeth to the Church of the Jewes, whoſe name to this day is a reproach, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be aſhamed, I will take away them that rejoyce in thy pride &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The ſanctification of the Church is further commended, that no affliction, paucity, nor poverty, (as when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Babylon</hi>) ſhould obſtruct, but rather help it on; the Lord emptying them of all things by affliction, that they may learne to truſt in God, and ſtudy holineſſe and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are approved in his ſight; whereunto they ſhall be encouraged by Gods protecting of them, and keeping them

As truſt in God is a chiefe part, and the root of true holineſſe; and as the afflicted may have yet ground of hope, and may riſe the more in confidence that trouble would lay him low, and that carnal confidences do faile: And as afflictions do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to be diſcouraged, but to put us to truſting and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dependance, and do feed faith; ſo to truſt in God, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily mans laſt ſhift, which he will never eſſay till he be emptied of all things beſide, and led by God to this duty, who undertakes to work faith as well as to give the reward of it; all theſe are imported in this promiſe, as it is propounded, <hi>I will leave in the midſt of thee an afflicted and poor people: and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord,</hi> and here their holineſſe begins. 4. Truſt in God will encourage and enable the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to follow holineſſe and Gods way; And, albeit perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not attainable in this life, yet the beliver is to prove his integrity, by avoiding the dominion of ſinne, and hypocriſie, and diſſimulation; and to emplore God for attaining thereof: This is the ſumme of that promiſe, <hi>The remnant of Iſrael ſhall not do iniquity, nor ſpeak lies: neither ſhall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth.</hi> 5. As God is ſufficiently able to give ſafety and ſupport to his own in their weakeſt condition; and as the godly have the Covenant-right to temporal preſervation when it is good for them, and are alwayes hid in the ſecret of Gods preſence, and may attaine to peace and freedome from the ſlaviſh feare of trouble: ſo the faith, or ſenſible experience of this protection, is a ſufficient motive to Saints, to ſtudy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and keep the way of God; This imported in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>They ſhall feed</hi> (as his flook) <hi>and lye down, and none ſhall make them afraid;</hi> and in its being ſubjoyned, as a reaſon why they ſhall ſtudy holineſſe; <hi>They ſhall not do iniquity, &amp;c. for they ſhall feeh and lye down, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord ſubjoynes yet further encouragements to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in two exhortations directed to the Church of the Goſpel, wherein yet more of her allowance, and priviledges are held forth. The firſt exhortation is to full joy, becauſe of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of plagues and enemies, becauſe of Gods preſence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the midſt of her, and her freedome from former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; importing a promiſe, that ſhe ſhould rejoyce becauſe of this, and that the godly of the preſent time might rejoyce in hope of it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the true Iſrael in ſpirit, children of <hi>Zion,</hi> and of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from above, and who are heirs to all the promiſes, have allowance, and matter of compleat joy above any other ſociety, whoſe joy is ſtill embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with ſorrow, and ought to entertaine their good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thankfulneſſe and rejoycing: So when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be converted, the Church may expect, that after their long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and bitter ſorrow, there will be a notable ſong among them; for, this exhortation, <hi>Sing O daughter of Zion, ſhout Oh daughter of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> is a warrant and direction to all the godly, ſhewing how ſhort they often come; and promiſe to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in particular. 2. Though ſinne and ſpiritual judgements, together with outward calamities following thereupon, and enemies both outward and inward do oft times trouble the Church, yet in due time they ſhall not mar her mirth, but rather furniſh matter of a ſong, when God having quit the proceſſe againſt her, and healed her ſpiritual judgements and plagues, ſhall ſpeedily remove them, and her enemies; <hi>Sing, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The Lord hath taken away thy judgements, he hath caſt out thine enemies:</hi> whereby <hi>judgements,</hi> we are not only to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her outward calamities, but all her ſpiritual plagues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:169976:172"/>ſinne, and all the Lords ſad ſentences againſt her, which were the riſe of the enemies invaſion and ſucceſs. 3. It is matter of great joy, to have intereſt in the true God of the Church, who is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> alſufficient to make his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers happy, and maintain his and their rights, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35.10. eſpecially when the right is made clear to beleevers, and that the Lord is not to their ſenſe ſtanding afar off, but very neer and in the midſt of them; which every one that lives by faith may expect; for this is alſo matter of a ſong, <hi>the King of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>even the Lord is in the midſt of thee.</hi> 4. Albeit the Church cannot promiſe to her ſelfe, to be wholly and perpetually free from trouble, while ſhe is within time; yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, may expect not to meet with thoſe judgements they have endured ſince their rejection: and the godly may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their own competent breathing times from trouble, &amp; that trouble ſhall not hurt them, nor prove <hi>evil</hi> when it cometh, and that the day ſhall come, wherein they ſhall be for ever freed from it, which may ſweeten what they meet with, that it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not their joy; this is imported in that cauſe of the Song; <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond exhortation (which the Lord promiſeth ſhall be directed to the Church, either by her Paſtors ſent out, or by way of acclimation from others, beholding her happy eſtate, particularly at their returne from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and at the converſion of all <hi>Iſrael</hi>) is, that by faith they would put away fainting feare, and ſtir up themſelves to ſerve God chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; for which end th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re are ſeveral encouragements ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following purpoſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is an uſual infirmity in the godly, that their diſpoſition comes far ſhort of their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; when they are allowed to <hi>be glad and rejoyce with all the heart,</hi> v. 14. they need to be ſtirred up not to <hi>feare</hi> or <hi>faint.</hi> 2. The people of God are many times ſo miſtaken of their own caſe, that others may ſee more of their good condition then
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:169976:173"/>themſelves, and they need the Miniſtery of the Word to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their thoughts, to which they ought to ſubmit; for, <hi>In that day it ſhall be ſaid to Jeruſalem, Feare thou not, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Faithleſſe fainting, feare and idleneſſe, are uſual compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which feed and entertain one another; fear weakning the hands from dutie, &amp; idleneſſe feeding diſcouragement yet more, therefore both are joyned here, <hi>Fear not, let not thy hands be ſlack or faint.</hi> 4. As the reconciled people of God have no cauſe of harmleſſe feare, if they would ſet themſelves againſt it; &amp; as it becometh them to go about any duty enjoyned by God, with alacrity and chearfulneſſe; ſo our encouragements in God are then rightly uſed, when they ſtrengthen us to duty; ſo much alſo do theſe exhortations, being put together, import, <hi>Feare not, let not thine hands be ſlack.</hi> 5. As it is the duty of faithful Miniſters, ſo alſo it is the commendation of all the godly, to ſtir up one another to encouragement through faith, and to chearfulneſſe in the obedience of faith, for, they are commendably employed, who <hi>ſay to Jeruſalem, Feare not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>The LORD thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty: he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with joy: he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The reaſon of the preceding exhortation, and the ground of their encouragement is taken from Gods Covenant made with them, and his preſence which was conſpicuous in the midſt of them; from which grounds they might expect not only that his power ſhould be employed for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but alſo that out of his love, wherby he had choſen them, he would delight and acquieſce in them, and rejoyce over them, and do them good, and ſweetly cheriſh them, notwithſtanding what might be ſaid againſt them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lords Covenant with his Church, is not broken off by every diſcord or affliction; ſo the Lord manifeſting himſelf to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with her, by his Ordinances, as ſignes of his preſence, ſaith much mercy to her, according as ſhe needs it, for the riſe of all
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:169976:173"/>the following encouragements, is, <hi>the Lord thy God in the midſt of thee.</hi> 2. As the Church may expect freedome from all her troubles, either by prevention, ſupport or deliverance; ſo her intereſt in God through the Covenant, makes his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency forth coming to her for that end, and ſhe may reckon her ſtrength by what is in him; for, <hi>the Lord thy God is mighty,</hi> and therefore, <hi>he will ſave.</hi> 3. Albeit the proofs of divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, let forth for the Churches good, do ſet him out above all bleſſing and praiſe; yet his love-embracements are above all, and the chief of the Churches encouragements; therefore are they added as a further degree of comfort; <hi>He will rejoyce over thee, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Albeit Chriſts Bride be of no worth to him, nor doth he need her, yet having choſen her to be his Bride, he will not come behinde in any duty, which ſuch a relation promiſeth or engaged to among men, but will take pleaſure to be her God, will eſteem, commend, cheriſh and delight in her, not according to her worth, but according to the dignity he hath called her unto, and as his wife, his love putting comelineſſe upon her; &amp; will expreſſe his delight by doing for her, as if her well-being were a ſufficient recompence of all his pains; for, <hi>He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over thee with joy,</hi> which points at his inward delight; <hi>He will joy over thee with ſinging,</hi> which noteth the outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it; and both of them borrowed from the carriage of a Bridegroome to his bride, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 62.5. 5. The Lords love doth ſo acquieſce in his people whom he hath choſen, as the end of his purſuit wherein he reſteth, and doth not onely cheriſh them by many expreſſions of love, when he taketh up his reſt in and with them; but anſwereth all objections that might be againſt them, with his own free love that hath choſen them: as reckoning, that having loved them, he will love them: and having let out his affection upon the unworthy, he will beare with their frailties, and not give a bil of divorce, nor chide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: Thus <hi>he will reſt in his love,</hi> or her whom he loveth, as having gained his end when he obtaines her; and in <hi>his love</hi> or affection to her, which is ſufficient to make him not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her, nor reject her; yea as the word ſignifieth, <hi>He will be dumb and deaf in his love;</hi> His love (to ſpeak after the manner of men) will guard his eare from hearing, and his mouth from uttering accuſations againſt her, to wit, ſo as to caſt her off, or denie her marriage entertainment, though otherwiſe he may humble her.</p>

                     <p>I will gather them that are ſorrowful
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:169976:174"/>for the ſolemn Aſsembly, who are of thee, to whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it was a burden.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord takes the word out of the encouragers mouthes, and himſelf applieth that more general promiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 7. to the broken and afflicted eſtate of the Jewes, for the encouragement of the godly remnant; promiſing that he would gather and bring them again to their own land, eſpecially thoſe, (or for their ſakes) who were mourners for the want of the ſolemne worſhip of God, as they had it in their own land, and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reproach following thereupon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is the dutie of all the people of God, to finde God ſpeaking in and by his Word unto them; ſo is his mind to be found in his Word, and no where elſe; for he doth himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what theſe exhorters had ſaid of him, <hi>v.</hi> 16.17. for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthning of the godly; and what they ſaid of him from his Word, that for ſubſtance doth he ſay of himſelfe, when he ſpeaks, <hi>I will gather, &amp;c.</hi> or employ my power and love to ſave, as <hi>v.</hi> 17. 2 The Lord ſpeaking by his word, will teach and allow his afflicted people, to apply general promiſes to their own caſe, as if they had been only intended for them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he apply that general promiſe of manifeſting power and love to the particular ſtrait of their captivity; I <hi>will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> that is, I will employ my power and love to help thee in thy particular diſtreſſe. 3. As the Lords people do oft times provoke him juſtly to deprive them of publick Ordinances, and to ſcatter them into corners: ſo the want thereof will be a ſad affliction to ſenſible ſoules, as depriving them of the moſt lively repreſentation of heaven on earth, as obſcuring much of Gods glory which is ſeen and ſpoken of in the Sanctuary, and as ſecluding the godly from the mutual and comfortable fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one of another in his ordinances, and from much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and help which they had by thoſe meanes; for here they <hi>are ſorrowful for the ſolemn Aſſembly,</hi> wherein the Jewes uſed to to meet at the Temple to worſhip God 4. Such is the inſolencie and cruelty of the Churches enemies, that the godly may not only look to be deprived of ſolemn Ordinances, where ſuch have power, but to have their burden and grief augmented, and to be in peril of being cruſhed with inſolent reproaching of their religion and worſhip; for here it is added to the former, <hi>the reproach of it was a burden.</hi> 5. When the Lord hath brought
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:169976:174"/>his people loweſt for their ſin, and enemies have got moſt of their will in cruſhing them, yet they are not without the reach of his help: he can, and in his appointed time will bring them out of all their captivities and troubles; for notwithſtanding all theſe afflictions, <hi>I will gather them,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 6. As it is the duty of the godly, in times of calamities to be moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what concerneth Gods honour, and ſeems to ſuffer prejudice: ſo ſuch do lie neareſt promiſes for the publick, or for themſelves either; for they that <hi>are ſorrowful for the ſolemn aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, are of thee;</hi> that is, thy true and kindly children; and they get the firſt promiſe, <hi>I will gather them,</hi> and the Church for their ſake.</p>

                     <p>Behold at that time I will undoe all that afflict thee, and I will ſave her that halteth, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her that was driven out, and I will get them praiſe and fame in every Land, where they have been put to ſhame.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord confirmeth this gracious promiſe of their return, and undertaketh to remove all impediments that might ariſe from themſelves or others, to hinder their gathering and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. As for outward oppoſition, he promiſes to ruine her oppreſſors; and for her ſelf, although by her affliction and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, ſhe were ſo broken and cruſhed like a disjoynted body, that ſhe was not able to move; yea ſo ſcattered as the torn members of a body caſt here and there into corners, that there is no probable hope of her gathering; yet he promiſeth not only to make a reſurrection from the dead, &amp; to ſtrengthen her who halted, that ſhe may return, and to cauſe the driven out to be gathered; but that by ſo doing he will take away their reproach in view of all people, among whom they had lurked with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is ſo much which the afflicted Church may have in probability and to ſenſe to object againſt the truth of promiſes; that the performance of them will be wonderful, and to be admired; for here we are called to admire the Lords brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about of his purpoſe, notwithſtanding ſo many ſeen impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Behold, at that time, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The promiſes made to the Church ſpeak much wo to her oppoſers, and will come to effect over the belly of all oppoſition they can lay in the way; <hi>I will
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:169976:175"/>undo all that afflict thee, and I wil ſave, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The Lords people may be ſo cruſhed by their troubles, and diſabled, to doe any thing for themſelves or their own help, and ſo caſt out from all their enjoyments, and ſo ſcattered from the ſociety one of another, and from having the face of a people, that it may ſeem impoſſible to ſenſe; that they ſhall be recovered, although there were no enemies againſt them; for its a new impediment to their faith that they <hi>halted,</hi> which is a cruſh diſabling from any activity or motion, and were <hi>driven out.</hi> 4. They may be brought to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low and deſperate condition by trouble, whom yet the Lord will not onely preſerve from ruine, but raiſe up (as it were) from the dead, and bring them to a full fruition of what he hath promiſed; <hi>I will ſave her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 5. Albeit reproach be a great addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to trouble, yet the Lords people waiting on him, may expect to have it rubbed off with advantage, and that by his mercies toward them, he will make them honourable in the ſight of all thoſe who deſpiſed them, becauſe of their low eſtate; <hi>I will get them praiſe, and fame in every Land, where they have been put to ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <p>At that time wil I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I wil make you a name, and a praiſe among all the people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, ſaith the LORD.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord yet inſiſts upon the former promiſe, and becauſe it was hard to beleeve ſo great a change, being as a reſurrection from the dead after ſo many years burial, and (as it were) rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their graves; therefore he repeats, and by ſubſcribing his own name, confirmeth the promiſe of gathering and bringing them back, and of making them famous throughout the world, when he ſhould return their captivity viſibly, and to their own ſatisfaction. He mentions the turning back of <hi>captivities</hi> in the plural number (as it is in the Original) with relation to their being led captives at ſeveral times, as under <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11. under <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.6. under <hi>Jehojachin,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35.10. (with every one of whom ſome of the people ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered) and under <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> and with relation to their being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into ſeveral places in their captivity, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they were
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:169976:175"/>to be returned as ſo many troups of captives; if not alſo to their long diſperſion ſince the Meſſiah came, as well as to the former in <hi>Babylon. Doct.</hi> 1. Greateſt difficulties in the way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of promiſes, ought not to cauſe the Church to doubt any thing of the certainty of them; therefore is the promiſe again &amp; again inculcated upon theſe fainting-Jewes, as a moſt certain truth whatever they had to the contrary whereupon to reject it: <hi>At that time will I bring you again.</hi> 2. One act of Gods power and love manifeſted for his people, doth but make way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to perfect it: and when the Lord begins a work with them they may expect he will not leave it unperfected; ſo much doth the way of making this promiſe import, that when he gathers them in their exile, (as he did under <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi>) he will not leave them, till he ſafely bring them back; <hi>At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you.</hi> 3. The Lords appearing for a people, and doing for them, is their greateſt honour before the world, conſidering what it ſpeaks of their intereſt in ſo great a God, what reſpect he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to them in their low eſtate, and how glorious he will make them by doing for them; and the Lord will in due time do for his people, that he may put his honour on them; therefore, it is here ſubjoyned as a fruit of his work, and his end in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will bring you again, for I will make you a name, and a praiſe among all the people of the earth, when I turne back your captivity.</hi> 4. The infinite fulneſſe of God is ſufficiently able to anſwer all his peoples wants, &amp; will not leave his work undone to their contentment, were their difficulties never ſo many; for, whereas they had been often led captives, and ſcattered into divers places, he promiſeth, <hi>I will turne back your captivities, and do it before your eyes,</hi> or to your full content and ſatisfaction. 5. The former proofs, which God hath given of his power, to give a being to what he ſaith in greateſt extremities, is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for the Churches encouragement, to lean to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in new difficulties: therefore to confirme all he ſubſcribes his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by which he had been known in their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 6.3. as a ſufficient ground for their faith in this ſecond captivity: <hi>I will turne back your captivity ſaith the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah. Of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</hi> Rom. 11.36.</p>
